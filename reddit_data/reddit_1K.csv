0,"this actually happened a couple of years ago. i grew up in germany where i went to a german secondary school that went from 5th to 13th grade (we still had 13 grades then, they have since changed that). my school was named after anne frank and we had a club that i was very active in from 9th grade on, which was dedicated to teaching incoming 5th graders about anne franks life, discrimination, anti-semitism, hitler, the third reich and that whole spiel. basically a day where the students' classes are cancelled and instead we give them an interactive history and social studies class with lots of activities and games. 

this was my last year at school and i already had a lot of experience doing these project days with the kids. i was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders. we start off with a brief introduction and brainstorming: what do they know about anne frank and the third reich? you'd be surprised how much they know. anyway after the brainstorming we do a few activities, and then we take a short break. after the break we split the class into two groups to make it easier to handle. one group watches a short movie about anne frank while the other gets a tour through our poster presentation that our student group has been perfecting over the years. then the groups switch. 

i'm in the classroom to show my group the movie and i take attendance to make sure no one decided to run away during break. i'm going down the list when i come to the name sandra (name changed). a kid with a boyish haircut and a somewhat deeper voice, wearing clothes from the boy's section at a big clothing chain in germany, pipes up. 

now keep in mind, these are all 11 year olds, they are all pre-pubescent, their bodies are not yet showing any sex specific features one would be able to see while they are fully clothed (e.g. boobs, beards,...). this being a 5th grade in the rather conservative (for german standards) bavaria, i was confused. i looked down at the list again making sure i had read the name right. look back up at the kid. 

me: ""you're sandra?""

kid: ""yep.""

me: ""oh, sorry. *thinking the kid must be from somewhere where sandra is both a girl's and boy's name* where are you from? i've only ever heard that as a girl's name before.""

the class starts laughing. sandra gets really quiet. ""i am a girl..."" she says. some of the other students start saying that their parents made the same mistake when they met sandra. i feel so sorry and stupid. i get the class to calm down and finish taking attendance. we watch the movie in silence. after the movie, when we walked down to where the poster presentation took place i apologised to sandra. i felt so incredibly terrible, i still do to this day. throughout the rest of the day i heard lots of whispers about sandra. i tried to stop them whenever they came up, but there was no stopping the 5th grade gossip i had set in motion.

sandra, if you're out there, i am so incredibly sorry for humiliating you in front of your class. i hope you are happy and healthy and continue to live your life the way you like. don't let anyone tell you you have to dress or act a certain way just because of the body parts you were born with. i'm sorry if i made you feel like you were wrong for dressing and acting differently. i'm sorry i probably made that day hell for you. i'm sorry for my ignorance.",confuse a 5th grade girl for a boy in front of half of her class. kids are mean. sorry sandra.**
1,"it was last october, but i'm feeling the fall-out from it the most today.  

after my mom died from cancer last year, i started looking for my estranged father.  i had only known him for a short time when i was 6 and barely remembered more than his name.  i never knew why he left and my mom would not talk about him without obvious emotional pain, so i didn't push her for information about him.  i figured he didn't care about us.

i had googled him multiple times over the years, but he was always unlisted and i didn't have an address with which to search.  after her death, i felt strongly that he should at least know that she died and that i have a beautiful little girl.  it felt wrong that he might be out there somewhere knowing nothing about us.
i googled him again and came up with a phone number and address that seemed realistic.  i called, figuring it was going to be another person by the same name since i'd already experienced that several times while looking for him.  it wasn't.

i had no idea how he would react to me, but he was ecstatic.  he told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he didn't pursue custody of me because he felt himself to be selfish and unstable.  he said he knew that my mom and my family would love me and take wonderful care of me (he was right about that!  my mom was the best woman i've ever known).

so, we started talking and skyping.  we spent a lot of time learning about each other. knowing how he had hurt my mom and bailed on me made it difficult to see him as the person he has grown to be, but i tried to believe that people can change for the better.  

he was exactly everything i needed in a father my entire life:  supportive, sweet, funny, loving.  eventually, i told him that i loved him after months of talking with him.  he was over-the-moon.

fast-forward to actually meeting him in person.  this is the part where, without knowing my dad or me, you might feel that i sound like an ass.  i say this because i don't have a precise reason or event that i can point to as to why i don't trust him.  why he actually makes me really nervous.

my dad is really touchy and hovers all of the time.  he doesn't smell clean and his teeth are rotting and crumbled.  he doesn't give personal space and, when i spent a couple of nights staying at his trailer, he kept coming in to my room to check on me while i was sleeping.  he said that he was just so excited to have me there that he couldn't help it, but i really felt uncomfortable with it.  i couldn't sleep and was so glad that i didn't even consider bringing my daughter without spending time with him first.

he also asked me if he could kiss me on the mouth because his family does.  i said ""no"" and he accepted that, but the constant touchiness continued.  it wasn't anything strictly inappropriate, but it made my skin crawl.  
i've spent very little actual time with him in person, maybe 2 weeks total over several trips.  i have, however, talked with him for countless hours on the phone and skype.  

during the most acute months of grieving for my mom, he was so devoted to me, trying to talk me through whatever he could.  i was so grateful for it that i kept ignoring details about his character that really concerned me.  he actually demanded a lot of my time, like hours and hours every day and would get upset if i cited my daughter and husband as reasons that i needed to chill with the phone.  he never paid my mom child support and obviously was never there for us my entire life.  he also evaded taxes and told me he had been to court 9 times and jail once.  

again, i know people can change, but at this point, i find myself wanting less contact with him.  the idea of him spending any time with my daughter alone is out of the question and my husband feels the same concerns.  i don't want to hurt him, but i just can't trust him.  i don't even know if i'm asking for advice or confessing to being stupid and rushing into something that will hurt someone.

thank you for reading and i sincerely want to wish all the wonderful father's out there a very happy father's day!

2,"so i had the brilliant idea to use veet hair removal gel as the ol' danglies were in need of a trim and i had heard that veet leaves them smoother for longer. well i guess thats right when the skin has to grow back first. 

pre-story: i tried this before and the results were great but i had decided to do it again because of how well it worked. 

so i take out the gel/cream stuff and just lob it on and cover the forest. the slight peroxide kinda smell ensued and all was going well, there was a slight burning but thats to be expected, you know, melting pubes off does that. so comes the all and mighty time of scraping that stuff off, top half all good, no pain or anything. but, the danglies were what was burning, i scraped them and withstood the pain because well lets face it, men are men and a little pain for balls as smooth as jam jars is fine right? wrong, it did great at taking the hair off it, but decided to take the first layer of skin too, my nuts now glow cherry red and walking is a painful expense that can't be justified.
i feel sauron has just tipped them in mount doom and dragged me balls first down the side of a rock wall.",had my balls burned by sauron and was left deveeted.
3,"today i was going to have a bath after a long day of painting kids faces at a carnival. all would go well, except being the genius i am, i put in some epsom salts (i always do for my bath), and i grabbed my bottle of peppermint essential oil.

 lately, i've been on a diy-pinterest-tumblr-let's-make-my-own-shit-and-be-fancy spree. the other day i took a 'detox bath' (fyi did nothing for me guys. uselessss). so, my brain totally went 'hey, trajectorys, put some peppermint in! it's good for your skin!' okay brain!

so, instead of logically putting in like... 5 drops so it's nice and minty fresh smelling and just enough to work, i literally shook the thing full force all over the top of the bath water. i'm talking like... probably 50-100 drops. so i finish running the water, turn it off, and hop in.

first five minutes went really well.. and then the cold started. okay, this is fine, it just is the peppermint cooling my skin. brain is like, just wait it out. so i stayed in.

ten minutes in and i'm moving back and forth trying to keep the warm water warm, if i stopped moving it was like sitting in the water at the foot of a glacier. so i sit up.

you know that feeling when you brush your teeth and drink ice water? that immense cold in your mouth? my back felt like that immediately. 

so now i'm sitting here and my back, my butt, and my ladybits are burning cold. like, sitting in the snow naked kind of cold. it's really uncomfortable... so indeed, tifu.",peppermint + bath = burning cold ladybits.
4,"i haven't had a bath in practically years so, after finally moving into a house with a bath, i decide to have one. having recently purchased a shiny new bag of weed, i thought combining the two would be a good idea.

picture this; a very cramped bathroom, no windows, a shitty extractor fan, closed door, steaming hot bath and a spliff. as i lay there gently swishing to and fro, giggling like a little school girl, i neglected to notice how hot the room was becoming. 

after a while i looked up and realised i could barely even see the taps in front of me. naturally, i begin to panic and started scrambling around trying to escape. i grabbed a towel, stood up and immediately fell back to the floor. all i could see was black for what felt like 5 minutes, my heart was pounding and i could feel the blood rushing past my ears.

once the feeling passed i stumbled into my bedroom and stood in front of the mirror, facing me was an extremely red version of myself with a bleeding shoulder. 

currently, my heart rate has almost returned to normal and i'm starting to feel and look less like a lobster. 2/10 would not recommend.","got too high and too hot in the bath, almost cooked myself like a lobster."
5,"this was like 2 and a half weeks ago maybe 3. so i left my house to meet up with my girlfriend at a spot in some sorta wood type thing near some nice houses. on my way i saw landscape workers working around the houses and cleaning.  i meet my gf and go find a spot in the woods. the spot we went to seemed nice and lonely for the both of us to hang out. i cant remember if we smoked or not (fried) but i was horny and i'm sure she was too so we start making out and start touching each other all over the place. then we start having sex in the woods. we were having sex peacefully until we heard workers. they sounded far but every second they seemed to get closer.  we realized that they were just a few feet away.  quickly me and my gf got up and get dressed and  head over to a different spot which was not a good idea. we were kinda laying there and i told her that i wanted to finish, she said okay but she wanted to do it right there.i don't know what made me look back but when i do i see the landscapers and they were looking our way. there was about 3 or 4 workers. we quickly got off each other. i don't know for how long they were watching but they were watching. one kept looking our way. i was so embarrassed. bastards ruined it too ;) we just hung out for a bit after and went our separate ways. i wont forget that day.",i had sex with my gf in the woods and got caught by landscape workers.
6,"so, my oven is broken...and i'm out of cooking oil, but i want some french fries. so i search the internet and find that if you cover french fries with something, either napkins or another plate and microwave them, they turn out ok. so i tried it, i took to plates, smushed em together and put the french fries in the microwave. (don't try this at home) 
 half way through the five minute cooking cycle i pull the plate out. steam billowing out the crack between the two plates. i lift off the top plate and let it cool down a but, i touch the french fry and it's warm but a tad bit cold, i feel around and flip them with my fingers (genius!) and then i reach the center of the plate. 
 freeze frame, have you ever microwaved something, like chicken nuggets, and the nuggets near the edge of the plate are colder than the ones in the middle? well this is exactly what happened, but a thousand times worse. since the fries have been blanched, frozen, bagged, and then put into my freezer, that means there's still some oil in the fries, and the microwave brought out that oil and boiled it, 
 so i was poking around the fries when my finger squishes into a really soft one, right into the hell-fire center, where broiling hot potato smushes under my finger nail, i jump back in shock and flail around my hand whispering ""ow, stop, ow, stop, ow, stop"" i cover the plate, start the microwave, and walk away, suddenly, this burning sensation just erupts over the tip of my finger, full on pain train. i step into the bathroom and run it under cold water, only to find out. we're out of burn cream!

so now i'm sitting at my desk, with first degree burns on my index finger which i stuck in a bag of frozen corn 
as i type with one hand.

 

update: i put aloe vera on the end of my finger and it feels like little tiny snow angels grinding up against my finger, so gud",tried to microwave french fries and stuck my finger into a franken-fuck of pain causing first degree burns
7,"this technically happened yesterday since it 1:30 am here, but i can't sleep because i'm worried. 

before i start, let me set the scene. it's getting close to 6 on a mildly wet western north carolina summer day. not too much rain, but enough to get the grass wet, and i'm in the really mountainous part of wnc. 

so anyway, after hanging out with a friend of mine, we decide to visit another friend at her house since we're nearby.  i pull up the driveway, see other friends' truck in the way, so i try to go around. the friend i was riding with got ""wait there's a-"" out just as i heard a *thunk*. ""-ditch there."" got-dang it bobby. so i get out, lo and behold i'm stuck. if my truck had 4 wheel drive, i wouldn't have been as concerned. so i try to go further forward. i hear a *snap*. ""well you broke my pipe, but that's fine."" turns out i snapped a ~3 inch pvc pipe (i guess for drainage) and it was now lodged in front of my right front tire.

now here's where it gets interesting.

i leave my truck in neutral, go out to look at the pipe. think *oh, i can get that out from under there.* when i do, the whole truck comes rolling forward (remember; mountain country, i'm stuck on a slope.) i dodge the truck, which hits the girl's barn. neither the barn nor the truck was hurt, but i was pinned between the truck and the barbed wire fence on the passenger side. after reassuring everyone there i was a-okay, one of the girls called her cousin, who brought a jeep and a chain. i wriggle my way out of the wire, ever-so carefully step over the wire to make sure i can still have both boys and girls, not just one or the other, and make my way over to help hook things up and such. 

long story short, we get it uphill a little, get another truck involved, get it angled better, cut the fence, and i drive my truck down the adjacent field (what the fence was there to fence off), and everything is okay. i ended up with just as many scratches as the truck. i just got a text to call the girl's mom tomorrow, and i'm worried that she'll tear me a new butthole after this.","my truck went vroom vroom into a ditch. i tried to get it out, and it tried to kill me. after shouting ""ole!"" and getting scratched up more than a husband having sex with a kinky cougar, two rednecks helped me out of a perilous predicament. and now me, my testicles, and my truck are all safe and sound."
8,"earlier today, i was at the local county fair in the lovely county of adams in wisconsin. i was there to enjoy the fair, help out and have a wonderful day. however, later in the afternoon, i found myself in the rabbit, chicken, duck, goose and dairy barn. i was behind a row of rabbit cages with my cousin, which bordered up to the wooden fence divider between the rabbits and dairy cows. 

this beautiful heifer decided she wanted to poke her head through to the rabbit side  for what i thought, was to get a good scratch behind the ears, and on her bump. she however, had other thoughts. she was just interested in getting the bucket of water on the floor that was meant for watering the rabbits.

when i reached down to scratch her, she tolerated it for about 10-15 seconds. at the end of those few seconds, i was looking away speaking to my husband, son, and cousin. all of a sudden, a loud thwack and searing pain in my right hand. i looked down, and she had my hand squished in between her head/head bump and the wooden fence post in the barn. 

after i got my hand loose, about ten seconds after the initial hit, it was already turning purple with a huge blood pool underneath my middle finger nail, as well as the base of the nail was bleeding in the cuticle. my other finger nails felt like i had played that stupid bite down on them as hard as you can, then push your fingers together game. so as of right now, my hand is still in serious pain, the nail is purple and has some serious blood build up underneath it. as well, all the rest of the blood vessels in the top of my finger have burst so its about three times the size it should be. so this is how i screwed my hand up, by fucking up and mistaking a heifer's want for water, as the want for attention.","i fucked up by mistaking a heifer's want for water as a want for attention, petted it, and screwed my hand up pretty bad. mainly the middle finger."
9,"so recently i have come down with a nasty upper respiratory infection and have been coughing a lot.  

today, i was sitting in the cafeteria at my college when i felt a particularly big cough coming on. it was a very effective cough, and apparently too effective, because instantly i realized i had shat my pants.  while some may have been embarrassed, i was actually quite excited.  after spending so much time reading about people who shat them selves, you start to wonder what it feels like.  well, now i know.",i coughed so hard i shat my self and was happy about it.
10,"so yeah it actually didn't happen today but about 5 years ago. i was still a virgin and kind of frustrated about it. you know how it goes ""shit i'm still a virgin...""

so i was at this party and i heard that there was a girl which i heard she was pretty easy(let's call her easy girl from now on). so for the rest of the evening i spent drinking, i went outside to smoke. there was easy girl. i was really fucked up, but i thought hey, let's try this! i took her apart to someones driveway. we began to kiss, started to go down on her. everything went alright i even brought a condom! (well look at that!) i started fumbling around with my dick since i was drunk and never done it before.

we fucked for a while but then i decided since i couldn't feel anything, let's take the condom off! great idea! now i was so fucked up i couldn't come so i asked her if she maybe would give me a blowjob. she agreed and gave me a blowjob (here is where the fuck up comes) when i thought i came i actually peed in her fucking mouth, no shit. i thought i came but my prostate thought otherwise. 

she gargled a little bit and then spit it out...never spoke to her since and sometimes when i see her mother, she gives me this weird look. i don't know if she knows...",lost my virginity on someones driveway with a girl i didn't give a shit about and peed in her mouth.
11,my boss had a stroke. he was hospitalized today. while a coworker was explaining his status i had my ear buds in and was laughing hysterically like a hyena at adviceanimals.,caught laughing during bad news
12,"this happened this last weekend  we all know that ""i'm glad you came"" song right? yeah i now will forever hate that song 

let me rewind i am 22 years old and in college my mom and sister came to pick me up for the weekend because my car is at the shop
well anyways that song comes on my sister starts singing it and of course, me the idiot would be the one to say ""thats what your mom said last night' she immediatley smacked me and the mouth and pretended nothing even happened.",i told my sister i came on my mother last night because of a song she was singing
13,"every day i drive to a park and ride, which is about 2 miles away from my place. well this morning as i was leaving, i left my keys on the counter and locked the door on the way out. it was both my car keys and my condo keys and i had no way back in. my wife had left for work 5 minutes earlier; i tried calling her and she didn't answer. 


so i decided to walk...not three steps down the stairs i felt a fart coming on...i let it out slowly because i haven't been feeling great lately, and i felt a wet juicy fart slip out of my cheeks, only it wasn't just a fart it was diarrhea. it wasn't a lot, but enough to feel terrible.  


i had no choice though, but to walk; and of course, living the greater seattle area, it started raining. it was a 25 minute walk, then a 30 minute bus-ride with runny crap between my cheeks. the only good news was that when i got to work, my underwear wasn't too badly stained.","locked myself out of my car and condo, sharted, had to walk in the rain 2 miles to the bus."
14,"so, this girl in my class and i have been working on a number of projects lately and we've developed a great connection.  there seems to have been a number of signals, her calling things ""our song,"" texts for no reason, etc...  the only problem was that i was her group leader (she was working under me) and i felt it inapropriate to make my move while that was still the case.

fast forward to last night, she comes over for a few drinks before we meet up with other classmates for a night at the bar.  the project finished the day before and i was starting to make more physical contact between us.  

friends come over, i get wasted....wake up the next morning with a different girl in my bed and her ignoring my calls.

reddit, i fucked up!","like a girl, finally decided it was safe to make a move, slept with a different girl, fucked everything up"
15,"(technically this is more of a three years ago i fucked up, but i digress...)

back in the good old school days, we had friday sport. this term, myself and a group of friends decided to join the representative touch footy team, and we were waiting for the bus to take us to our semi final match.
my friend was sitting on the side of the grassy hill where we were waiting, and yelled ""oi, come over here!"" and patted her lap.

so, naturally i went over and jumped into her lap, in a weak attempt to crush her legs. much laughing ensued, which attracted the attention of our other friends. so, we ended up in a pile of about 10, resembling a pile of stacked-up chairs.

one of my teachers noticed, and walked over to us, shaking his head slightly. of course, what is the most natural response to seeing a stack of people sitting in each others laps? push the stack.
so, with eight people in front of me (with some pretty serious weight adding up there), we fell over sideways.

as the laughter increased tenfold, i heard a very faint clicking sound. feeling my leg tense up, i looked down. bad move.

about five centimetres to the right of my leg was my knee cap, hanging (or levitating as it appeared from my angle) in midair.

so, after a number of very unladylike expletives and a bit of yelling/screaming, people noticed that my knee cap had attempted to escape my leg and called an ambulance. 
then the bus showed up.

so, while my friends went to sport and got their asses kicked by a fellow high school, i sat on the side of the hill with my fucked up leg.
the paramedics show up, and ask if they can try and put my knee cap back in place without pain killers. at this point, the extremely light spring breeze which is flowing feels like razor blades cutting into my tendons, so i wasn't exactly keen on this idea.

so, they picked up the end of my leg and pulled.

i think i punctured an eardrum, screaming. 

they realise that this might not be the best plan, so i'm bundled up onto a stretcher and head off to hospital. driving in an ambulance with a dislocated knee cap was never on my bucket list, but at least i've crossed it off?

when i arrive at the hospital, i'm finally given the good pain killers (nitrous oxide for the win, none of that ""green whistle"" shit) and the er physio walks in. it took three people to stabilise me, while he pulled my foot and twisted. behold, my knee cap finally pops back in! they waited for me to come down of the high of the nitrous before fitting me in a knee brace and crutches.

note for the wise - a knee brace which holds your leg completely straight, thus making one leg longer than the other, will fuck you over. worst two weeks ever.

after a month, with crutches, a knee brace and some really pleasant taping, physiotherapy and an inability to climb stairs easily, my knee was finally released from its self-induced prison.

i've never sat in that friend's lap again. i also got an a in geography from that teacher at the end of that term.

edit:","sat in my friend's lap, douchebag teacher dislocates my knee, kneecap decides to stay locked to the side until i got to the hospital, drugs then two weeks on crutches."
16,"so i got a windows 7 ultimate disc and decided i should upgrade and start fresh. i decide that i will keep all my files (about 400 gigs) so i brought my laptop to school to hook up to one of the extra hard drives while i had decided to reinstall. so get to school and whats the first thing my dumbass self does? put the installation disc in and format the whole hard drive without backing up. so now i have lost all my videos, half finished projects, notes and school work.",i wanted to upgrade my windows but didn't back up my files so now i have 400 gigs of videos and school work to redo/redownload.
17,"okay so this morning i woke up extremely tired, looking for a way to wake my self up (i don't go back to sleep easily, so i decided to wake up instead). i chose food (what else!?)

so i went to the kitchen, poured some cereal into a bowl and got a cup, got out the milk and juice (i have the same god damn thing every day), and poured the milk into the cup and the juice on the cereal.

thing is, as i was tired as fuck, i didn't notice until i put the first mouthful in my mouth. i noticed the odd taste, and actually liked it. i finished my breakfast as it is, no complaints. won't do it again though, as it was a ridiculous amount of juice.",woke up tired as fuck and poured juice on my cereal and liked it**
18,"**warning!: wall of text which could easily be viewed as really fucking boring**

the background of the relationship is that we had met online and hadn't met yet. he lives 200 miles away from where i live, but my life's rather busy and he doesn't have a job right now (unemployment in his region is over 50%, so i don't blame him). he's a very kind, sweet human being, and i probably would have been lucky to end up with him. now, i'm not from the country i'm currently studying in, but i would like to end up here eventually. it seemed that the stars had aligned in showing me that there was hope for love here… boy, was i wrong.

there's a huge secessionist movement within a different region (one which neither of us live in), which has been gaining traction over the years, especially with the recent economic collapse. i am a lover of said region; it's the place where i feel the most comfortable in the entire world — the people, the cuisine, the culture… all of it just *fits*.

he, however, does not feel the same way about this region. i already knew that, but it had been bothering me since he had called people from there ""obnoxious sheeps [sic]"", amongst other things. we have always had different communication styles (i'm a fucking loudmouth and he's rather reserved), but we had been making it work. this morning, however, i couldn't hold back some of my worries, and amongst other things, i mentioned how he wants to live in an entirely different country and how i would not.

the  

i don't know what else to say, really. i debated with him my point as best as i could, calling out flaws in his argument about the nature of the secessionist movement and the national identity of the people from that region. for a while i thought he could at least be tolerant of my deep regard for it but… it would appear that even that was impossible. i got fed up with his ad hominem attacks on me and on the people who live out there, and i told him he can act like a child all he likes, but it doesn't make a whole group of people terrible just for their geographical location.

tbph, i'm a bit numb to it all. in january i had a whirlwind romance which tore me to pieces by the end of it. and having this happen without ever even meeting to see if we're compatible in the real world… welp, i'm just done with men for a while. i don't feel anything and my only reaction to this whole thing was to clean my room and wash my sheets in a fervor. he apparently felt awful that he'd lost my respect, but rather i deleted him from all of our sources of communication, which i did so i wouldn't have to deal with his remorse.

i'm not sure if i really fucked up today but… it would have been nice to at least have *tried* to make things work instead of leaving things off on such a sour note. c'est la vie.","would be that **he effectively told me i should live in a region he hates and i admire because i clearly don't understand the political climate — in so many words, we should break things off.** however, it's much deeper than that. apparently, half his family is from said region (and it's the half he dislikes, of course), and he had lived there a very brief period of time. despite all that, apparently he had never had a bad time there and no one ever did any harm to him. so i really couldn't figure out what his beef was with this place that has always seemed so charming to me."
19,"i had my electronics class today and my professor gave us an assignment where we have to make something from nothing. nothing being the broken computers and other electronics that we could find in our workroom. 

my group decided to build a boat, because honestly, hot gluing a block of styrofoam to a cpu fan is the easiest idea that any of us could think of, but we wanted to get a bit more creative. we found a couple of speakers in an old bin, and one with the audio output still intact with an auxiliary headphone cable, so we decided to play around with them a bit and see if we could mount them on our boat. 

before we began work on them, we had to see that they worked, so i took the speaker with the intact audio output, plugged it into my phone, hooked up the speaker to the oscillator, kicked it up to five volts, and started playing a song on my phone.

little did i know that the current would travel through the speaker, up the auxiliary cable, into my phone's audio input where the battery beyond had a maximum load capacity of only three point eight volts. 

i literally held my phone in my hands as the voltage fried my motherboard and the screen turned black, never to turn on again.",i bricked my phone by giving it shock therapy with an oscillator.**
20,"i seldom go to starbucks but today i decided i should go, well inner me decides, ""hey! lets get a frappucino!""  i'm lactose intolerant and coffee usually upsets my stomach, but hey i really wanted to go to try the new hazelnut frappe and this totally escaped my mind. just because hey i'm thirsty! so i order it and drink it, shockingly for the first time in a while it didnt upset my stomach. wow! so i go on about my day and go to the library for a couple of hours, leave campus and go to my local grocery store to buy lunch. 

i finally feel a rumble and start feeling cramps. fuck this isn't good so i hurry about my business. i walk through the store and thought i had to fart. i was too trusting because next thing i feel is a warm splooge leaving my ass. fuck this is not good! so i hurry and check out and get to my car. i squeeze my ass cheeks together and semi waddle to my car. right when i get to my car it builds up and my body decides,"" fuck you bro!"" i shit myself. i felt warm hot liquid leave my ass, i cry a little. thankfully i did have a change of clothes and found a public restroom.","go to starbucks, shit myself."
21,"this was actually a few weeks ago, but over the course of my relationship with my girlfriend we have shared quite a lot of intimate texts between each other. among those however are the rest of our texts, usually filled with sweet messages, thoughtful things, important life events, etc. i have my phone set to back up all of my texts and upload them to my dropbox account, which is synced with my computer.

one day, i had to help share a file between my computer and my brother's. i set up my dropbox account on his computer so that the file transfer could be easier. little did i know, his computer would not only have access to my files, but be notified when a new file was uploaded.

a few days later, my phone uploads the recent backup of my texts, and my brother sees it. since it had a weird file name, he opened it to make sure it wasn't some virus. sure enough, the first text he sees is the beginning of a sext from my girlfriend, going into much detail about how we want to fuck each other and how horny we are. he didn't read the whole thing, but now my younger knows about my sex life in excruciating detail.

edit","accidentally backed up sexts to brother's computer, he discovered them, he now knows the things my girlfriend and i do in bed."
22,"well it wasn't today but rather last night.... after a few drinks and a blunt (we are both ents), my boyfriend and i decided to ""do the dirty"" since its been a few days. we were getting really into it when he decides he wants to do anal again. i'm not a big fan but we have done it before and he knows to be gentle so i said why not. i'm pretty sure he was on e too because he lasted way longer than normal and he was going pretty fast when we switched it up. after telling him a few times to slow down because it hurt, he switched back to good old vaginal intercourse from behind. well, here is where the fuck up happened. any of you ladies who have done anal are probably aware of that ""poopy feeling"" after, so of course that was happening. he was still going in from behind, so i decided to stick my butt up and arch my back down because it drives him insane, when all of a sudden i felt a fart rumbling through.....then it happened. though, it was more than a fart. we both stopped and i asked sheepishly if there was a mess, he said no then promptly ran to the bathroom. i heard the shower go on and that's when i knew he was just trying to not make a big deal of it. 

when he came out of the shower i ran in the bathroom almost in tears and showered as well. i came back out and didn't even want to say anything, i was horrified. he assured me it was ok and that we would pretend it never happened, and all night and all day he was being a lot nicer than usual knowing that although i'm not embarrassed by much at all, when i am embarrassed, i don't take it lightly.",i sharted on my boyfriend during sex.
23,"ok so first off i would like to say its not funny till the end so prepare to be like ""o shit"" and then ""is this ever going to end"" but enjoy.
 so i was going downstairs about 2 hours ago to get something to eat and possibly to drink. while downstairs i notice my mother eating a salad, and naturally i was like fuck yea salad i love me some salad. upon investigation of the refrigerator i notice that there isn't any salad left. (btw fuck you grammer nazi's because i dont care about my punctuation) i decide that im going to be crafty...so i grab it and sneak behind my mother and yell loudly that i was the salad ninja and stole a bite. now as this happens she turns and looks at me with dissapointment  in her eyes as she yells ""stay off my fu-......."" and at that moment she looks up at me and gasps that she cant breathe and needs help. so i do what i think the fucking heimlich maneuver is, which wasnt pretty at all, and fail horribly and start yelling for her to breathe because it was all i could think to do and this woke my step-dad. at this moment i realized she was coughing which means she was breathing to some extent. my stepdad rolls in the kitchen and tries to pull off his version of the heimlich maneuver as well which also wasnt pretty at all. and after some trial and error he looks at me realizing she is breathing as well sort of saying ""what the hell are we in here doing as far as i know shes fine."" then he looks back down at her only to look up again and stare into my eyes as if he is looking at my soul or something for at least 15 seconds which felt like a year or something. then my wife comes down the stairs and she starts freaking out and calls the ambulance and i realize why she was shocked as i saw the puddle of blood coming from my mothers mouth. the squad showed up and they asked questions like her name and other various things a squad would ask before packing her up in the gurney and rolling out to the hospital. my step-dad left shortly after and i havnt seen or heard from them yet. although i had a terrible realization just a few minutes ago...

i would like to start off by saying that my step-fathers half mexican daughter is coming to ohio tomorrow to see her father for the first time in her life. (she is 29 years old) so tomorrow is a very special day, but just like the dumbass idea of salad ninja i decided to be an ass again and do something even more stupid. i decided that since she is part mexican she must be catholic right? riiiiiiiiiiiiiight. so i also think who is the biggest catholic ever....muffuckin hitler. so since i was going to be the first person she sees at 10 am tomorrow morning i thought i would shave my head and all of my facial hair except for a hitler mustache and completely act like it was normal and this is how i look all the time. 

of course i forget about this completely as it was several hours before and no one else had known about it. this also made me realize that the 15 seconds my step-dad stared into my soul was actually the 15 seconds my step-dad was wondering why in the fuck does this dumbass have a fucking hitler mustache. as i have said i hadnt talked to anyone about it and no one knew anything about it, nor have i talked to anyone since it happened and im sure im going to hear about his when they all get home. im not really sure how to explain a hitler mustache to anyone, if anyone has ideas im open for them. however i definitely would say that i fucked up hardcore and this isnt going to be a good convo at all...fml.","i damn near killed my mom while being the ""salad ninja"" and had to explain what had happened to the paramedics while having a hitler mustache."
24,"this happened a few years back so i know its not today, but its my cake day and i do what i want. 

so i was working at a fast food restaurant working the grill. it was a particularly busy day, and i didn't have a lot of experience on the grill. i was working with a few good friends and this girl lets call her cathy. now cathy has burns on about 90% of her body which is very unfortunate, but cathy is also a huge bitch. cathy was working transfer(basically taking hamburger patties and putting them on the buns). so you can imagine what happens next... cathy is waiting for me to finish up a couple of patties but i know they have another half a minute or so until she should take them. then all of a sudden a wild order appears, i think it was grilled onions or jalapenos and some grilled chicken. so i throw these down real quick and start to go to town. in the process of this cathy tells me that she needs my meat. i tell her to give me a couple seconds, but that wasn't quick enough for her. she decides in horrible fashion that shes just going to grab it off the grill. so in my blatant ignorance i say ""i hope you burn yourself."" the mistake i just made quickly pours over me, but before i have time to correct myself and apologize she replies with "" i already have."" i immediately feel the daggers of empathy go through my heart, and try to apologize, but the damage is done and i realize that everyone around me is just staring. fuck...","told a girl with burns on 90% of her body ""i hope you burn yourself"""
25,"after much pleading with my girlfriend i was able to convince her to have special sexy times. that's right, i was going to take my love canoe to the grand tetons! not only that, but i was going to, for lack of something clever, cum right on her neck, which sounds fantastic and foolproof! how naive i was to think that i could do this without doing what i did instead. 

so we are going at it, i'm making sweet sweet glorious love to her sweet sweet boobs. i start to get some tingles and jingles brewing downstairs and i get ready for what i expect to be a wonderful and simple ejaculation. 

i get into position and angle everything towards her neck so it can easily be cleaned up afterwards. and then it happened. i ejaculated. but, it took this mysterious unexplainable angle. and it was as if time slowed down so as to allow me to watch every last moment of what was happening. instead of going straight out and to her neck, it went up and it had this stunning arching angle that ended up landing right straight in the middle of her eye. that's right, i came right in her eye with an angle that would not allow me to do that!

that is when i started uncontrollably laughing while i was straddling her body which caused my penis to bounce up and down in front of her face and smacking bouncing on her chest. as she was in pain, i could not stop laughing at what just happened. this caused her eye to get extremely red and i still couldn't stop laughing.",tried to make babies in my girlfriend's eye.
26,"i went on a road trip to visit my mom last week. it was my first time driving to nyc. my map app told me that it was a toll road so i pulled out $20 cash thinking it would be plenty. i'm from the midwest and i've never paid a toll that was higher than maybe $4. i've made the drive up i95 as far north as baltimore all the way down to ga and i knew there weren't any tolls until i went under the harbor and that one was only a few bucks. i felt prepared.

i pay a couple of tolls totaling $12 and now i'm on the jersey turnpike. i glanced at my ticket and assume that the $8 i have left should cover my toll just fine. i have not actually zoomed out of my route at all and have just been trusting the map to tell me where i'm going. 

turns out it doesn't even matter because i get in the wrong lane and end up being forced through the ez pass. i don't have one. there's no way to back up or turn around. cars are honking at me because i'm pretty much panicking at this point. my kids are in the car asking me what's going on and i have no choice but to go forward and hope that i'm not committing a felony or something. 

from there on it's rapid fire exits and the start of intense traffic going into the city. there's no place to pull over and pull more cash, nor did it even occur to me to do so because by now i'm no longer on an interstate. however, a few miles down the road and there's another tollbooth and they want $12, which, of course, i don't have because nothing in my years of interstate travel through middle america has prepared me for how much tolls are on the east coast. she waves me through and i feel like crying. i have taken cross country road trips alone with 4 kids since they were babies and have never once felt as stupid and incapable as i did then. 

fast forward to today and i get a bright orange envelope in the mail. it's an ez pass citation. not only do i owe them $13 (!) for the toll, but i'm charged an extra $50 as a fine. i'm praying that the other toll i owe doesn't have the same fee added to it. 

ironically enough, on the way home i accidentally picked a route consisting of state roads and didn't realize it at first. i literally paid $3 in tolls and shaved 2 hours off the trip by avoiding backed up metro traffic. but guess who had $150 in my purse just waiting for a tollbooth to materialize on the horizon?",gas to get from ga to ny round trip was around $200. tolls and citations will probably end up being over half that. so much for my idea to take a spontaneous road trip and surprise my kids with a visit to grandma's house.
27,"okay, so i just got off work today and i had to tell this story somewhere. i work in a call center for a cable company for their tech support. today i got a specific call about something along the lines of ""when i open internet explorer all that comes up is a giant white screen and i can never close out of the pages""

at first i thought, maybe he hit f11 and it cause the browser to go full screen. in the end i figured out he was actually using the new windows 8 operating system and just didn't know how to navigate it whatsoever. i'm not an expert on windows 8 by any means, but i thought i would at least give him a brief tutorial just to help him out even though it was out of my support boundaries. this guy was bounced from line to line and no one was willing to help him, so why wouldn't i make his day just a bit better by doing him this one favor?

well, for one, this guy was a bit strange. he was an older man, and 5 minutes into the call he let me know ""how beautiful of a voice"" i have. asked me my age and where i'm located (basically any information i was allowed to give out.) he repeated my name multiple times and just kept talking about how pretty my voice apparently is on the phone. i didn't think much of it, until we got to me showing him how to use his os. 

over the phone i talked him through typing in an address in the actual address bar at the bottom of the page on windows 8 and prompted him to type in a code which would allow me to remotely access his computer and navigate it/type stuff on it/use a highlighter/etc in order to show him how to use the computer. first things first, let's delete all those open tabs..

lucky me i guess, half those tabs were porn. straight up porn. my favorite had to have been the ""daddy daughter massage play"". definitely had me rethinking those questions i answered earlier in the call. anyways, when the tabs opened i heard him on the other line say ""oh, hello there!"" and i about died laughing. 

the rest of the call was super awkward, and now i'm pretty sure i have a phobia of old men calling me for technical support. but at least it's over.","tried helping someone with a problem even though it was out of my realm of support and ended up looking at multiple pages of an elderly man's porn, then had to close it out for him because he didn't know how. tifu."
28,"technically it was not today but last friday, hope you forgive me there. also, forgive the bad english of a spanish speaker.

  so i´m a nervous guy,and this week, the money my parents gave me for college went away faster than usual, because i had to buy some groceries on my apartment that i didn´t account for. now, i dont have a debit card so i can't get money from my savings that easily. so naturally i don't tell anything to my parents about me running out of money and i try to solve the situation myself by asking my friend to lend me some money, which i end up missmanaging, and by friday morning i had only enough money to return to my apartment and thats it. as i was pretty much bankrupt and i had to attend to some classes saturday morning, i give up and end up asking my parents to send me money. at this point all that goes through my mind is how bankrupt i am and how likely it is that money wont come on time and i´ll find myself with nothing to eat on saturday morning, so i was not paying attention while i took the bus back home.

the bus drivers where i live are pretty much insane, and policemen apparently dont care about this, so it was perfectly logical for the bus driver to skip a red light and go down my street at a 100km/h instead of 40km/h. in this moment i realize i will miss my stop, and there are no set stops for the bus on my country, outside of the capital city, so i yell at the guy to stop, of course he can´t go from a hundred to 0 in the half second that it would take him to get to my street. the guy slows down to 30km/h by the moment he gets to my stop, and i for some reason thought i could be a badass and jump/run out of the bus whithout fall damage cause well, my mind was all over the place about money, so i jumped from a moving bus, at 30km/h and the inevitable happens, i wreck my ankle like a total dumbass, and end up on the floor with gravel on my mouth, in front of the now fully stopped bus with people checking on me from the windows. out of pure shame i stand up and signal them that i'm ok and walk all the way to my apartment (approx 200m plus straircases) i lay on my bed and try to forget the incident by browsing reddit.

fast forward 3 hours and my ankle already is the size of a melon (a small melon), and i can't bear the pain. luckily this is also the moment that my cousin (who was sent to give me the money my parents were sending me) gets to the apartment so i ask him to get me to the hospital. long story short, i had a sprain and my tibia and fibula are half a cm more separated than they were supposed to be, which earns me a cast, a $300 bill with my cousin, and a lot of explaining to do at college to all the proffesors i end up owing exams, and to my already pissed parents.","jumped out of a bus, walked back home and got carried back to the hospital to find out walking normally was out of the table for the next two or three months."
29,"so, i was playing halo 4 at my friends house. we played like 5 matches, and i had been doing horribly.

we start up a game of free for all and we get at it. intense game. last 20 seconds and im tied with my friend who is sitting there split screening with me. i win by a kill.

herrs where i fuck up. i get so excited and all of us are cheering that i kick the xbox over. it makes a weird humming noise and we wait like 10 seconds before unplugging it.

he pops out the disc, and shit, its scratched. its now unreadable. i had to give him my copy. fuck.","im a loser at halo, win once, freak out, kick xbox, scratch disc, have to give him mine."
30,"ok, sigh. this happened last night.

my friend, brother and i went to go watch a movie at a local theatre. im getting over a stomach flu so ive been passing gas lately, sorry for the tmi. so we find a parking spot and i thought it would be funny to rip a huge one before we leave to see if the smell would still stay in the truck until after the movie, i really didnt need to so i tried to force one out! and boom... a big ass shart!!! i had the most embarrassing face on, my friend and brother asked me what was wrong and i told them what happened, and they were literally rofl. we were late for the movie because i had to take a pitstop at starbucks bathroom.

i took me a good 25 minutes to wipe up, throw away my boxers, and do anything else to clean myself up. i couldnt do anything about the smell tho. and when i was done, i opened the door and there was a line of people waiting for the bathroom. :/ fml","i forced a shart, cleaned up and stunk up a starbucks bathroom, and watched a movie commando."
31,"because my nails are super thick and i have scissors instead of clippers, i tend to forget clipping them every now and then, causing them to get super long and, and some cases, super fragile.

while i was pacing around, killing time by listening to music, i stumbled down the mini-steps into the hallway, sending my right big toe smashing into the back of my left foot. sure, it hurt like a bitch for a second, but i'd done it before and didn't think it was that serious. 

until i got into my room and saw the blood on my foot.

turns out my nail was so long, the leverage from the impact cracked it in half horizontally, and sent the sharp interior edge down into the nail bed, causing insane amounts of bleeding.

have i mentioned yet that i'm hemophobic? probably should've mentioned that.

now, because i also fucked up by not getting new sneakers recently and my only pair squeezes the hell out of my toes, i'm going to have to wear flip flops. in fourty degree weather.","suffered the agony of the feet, nearly passed out at the sight of my fuckup."
32,"it's the start of a glorious weekend. getting home from a long day, hanging out with close friends, getting the occasional call or text message to jump from one activity to the next. early evening i receive a text from what i believed, at the time, was a beautiful, yet intelligent woman i had been texting earlier that day. she's flirting with me, i'm flirting back and all is going smoothly. this sort of stuff carries on for the next few hours, until she she says she has to walk home from a local fast food restaurant. i ask her which establishment that she had dined (*actually wouldn't call this dining, but rather eating out*) that particular evening. she says that it was one that was particularly close by. i begin to ask whether she had moved from one home to another one close by, she says no. at the time, this didn't raise a red flag.

next day, we text back and forth. the usual winky face and the cliche flirtatious remark is made towards one another and i'm thinking to myself "" wow, could this be going any better?"" but then, reality struck. i received a call from the attractive woman that i had been texting the previous day and i looked at the number thinking ""oh god, what have i done?!"" soon, i scrolled through my text messages realizing that i was texting an obese, not so attractive male associate of mine. in shock, i instantly told the attractive female what the situation was, she laughed, of course, at what had happened. i still have yet to reply to the male associate of mine in fear of the awkwardness that has ensued.","make sure you know who you are testing, or else you may find things out about your associates that you wouldn't want to know."
33,"so today started like any other saturday. i picked up my buddy from his house and came back to mine to play some gamecube games. we got a bit hungry around 1-ish today and decided to get something we haven't eaten in a while. i offered my dad to buy him lunch and he said taco bell. i was hesitant because i never really eat there (i'm not big on taco bell, sue me). my dad reassured me that the loaded grillers they now serve we're great so i took is word, got my friend, my dad and myself a bunch of shit and had a nice lunch. the spicy chicken grillers are actually great and i had 3.

any way lets fast forward to about 7 o'clock. i have my girlfriend, my buddy and 2 other friends with us. we're all starving so my girlfriend suggests arby's. i say why the fuck not cuz it's been a while as well and i get a chicken, bacon and swiss sandwich and a chocolate shake. fucking delicious by the way. so we get back to my house and all is well. my girlfriend and i both smoke so throughout the day and night we are smoking as well. 

now fast forward again to about 11, i start getting cramps in my lower abdomen, like knife stabbing. i manage to ignore it, but around 11:40 rolled around and my one buddy and i are left at the house. i'm doing everything i can to hold it in. i bro-hug my buddy goodbye quick and i **sprint** to the bathroom whilst grabbing my laptop, charger, phone and smokes. 

which brings us to here. i'm past the hour mark and still going. i'm typing this as i take a sir harrington (look it up). also, no tp so i'm using paper towels. sorry for the wall of text.",i ate taco bell and arby's in the same day and i haven't left my toilet for a fucking hour with no tp! pretty sure my anus is bleeding**
34,"so i've been dating a girl for about 6 months. i'm bi, and she doesn't know that. i'm more sexually attracted to men, but i have more of an emotional attraction to her. anyway, today, we were sitting around bullshitting like we usually do. i decided i want to show her a new song that i found that i figure she would like. on iphone, if you double tab the home button, the multitask pane pops up. usually, when i double tap it, it goes to the music player. it didn't this time. not paying attention, i pressed where the play button usually is. instead of hitting play, i bring up my tumblr (where i have my porn). suddenly, my screen is filled with bear (big hairy men, not the animal) cock. i panicked and closed the app and tried explaining that my friend was messing with me sending various pictures. she played it off, but i'm not sure she bought it.","showed my girlfriend my gay porn collection, played it off as a prank."
35,"so there's this girl who works at a burrito place i like.
cool chick, we're friends, have been for a while.
so i'm thinking i'll go here for lunch. 
she's working, and i starting talking to her, hitting on her, cuz she's hot and i'm a guy so fuck it, why not. 
turns out, when i dated her friend a while back, and dumped her after a week (bitches be cray), she didn't like it.
also turns out, we aren't friends.  and she hates me.
so she takes my burrito and throws it (sour cream, guac and all) at me from over the counter.
best part: she's manager, so she doesnt get in trouble.","i hit on a lez, and had to settle for measly taco bell."
36,"so some fucker is dancing between a two lane road whenever a lane gets fucking clogged (and by clogged i mean he can't fucking brake and wait like a normal person), thinking he'll get to his destination 4 minutes quicker. my previous two attempts to block him from getting to my lane and stop pulling that fuckery failed, so i got a bit ballsier when he was in front of me.

i decide to go into a little side lane (where cars load and unload) and decide to pass the fucker that's currently in front of me with that space. fortunately i pass him, but unfortunately i knock a fucking mirror off the other car he was tailgating.

fml.

my car got a nasty scratch and the fucker that cut me off and pissed me off got off scot free. **fuck i wish i could have hit that motherfucker if i was going to hit someone.**

fortunately, the guy driving it was cool and only wanted $50 for the broken mirror on his car. people say that you should call insurance and police in accidents, but this wasn't a huge one, so i just paid the guy. might not be a smart idea on my part since he could claim damages that weren't present during the accident or other fuckery, but he didn't seem like a dick (and also might not be a resident/citizen; he wasn't a high roller from the looks of his car and clothes). i got his information and got him to sign a non-formal contract saying that i paid for the mirror. 

anyways, if you're reading this juan, thanks a lot. and to the fucker in la that pulled that shit, fuck you and your whole fucking family that raised you. i honestly wish you continue to drive like a fucking retard, so that you'll fucking die in an accident.

you fucking piece of shit.",had a bad day turn worse due to fucking trolling ass driver or crap. good guy juan understands and we're done with it.
37,"i work as sales in a manufacturing/distributing company that sells paper and plastic products. long story short, a distributor contacts me and is interested in spoons, requests prices, i give, and then orders. he gives me a card over email, which i should've suspected, but i didn't since it was a large amount of $$ and i'm based on commission. i try the card, and it works! we do two other transactions throughout the month, each card is under a different name and address... it all clears. another stupid move on my part. 

today i am told the company that i've been working with is a fraud company, all the credit cards i've been using were stolen, and all the products are gone. thankfully the last shipment we sent out was a local storage warehouse and we claimed about 8k back.. but still. pretty shitty. atleast now i know i probably won't lose my job.",accidently charged stolen credit cards up to $28k and shipped out products that are now gone.
38,"nothing too exciting with this tifu. i already submitted my university applications earlier and theres pressure on my parents to attend university because it's more prestigious and the odds of me getting a career post grad is higher than college, i also think it's part of their own benefit. but i wanted to apply to both because theres a prestigious animation program at a college 1 city away from here where many of pixar, disney and other industry giants employees are recruited from. it's a dream of mine to be an animator and definitely a pixar animator, but i knew my drawing skills were not up to par, but i thought it would be worth the application anyways. the only thing holding me back was the 95$ fee to apply. i tried to pay for it myself because i knew i'd have no support from my parents - but my card was declined each time i tried and my mom said i should ""think about it more before i apply"" all while speaking in a saddened/angered tone. i hadn't even asked my dad because i knew what his reaction would be. this was yesterday, lone behold today i log in to the college site and one of my program choices is gone, animation, the application queue for the program is full and they're not accepting anymore. should have just manned up and stood up for myself. instead now i have to wait another year to apply - while i'm a freshman in uni.",i delayed applying to college because i knew i'd have no parental support and i couldn't apply because my card kept being bounced back and declined. now the application deadline has passed.
39,"this bar i have been going to has my little sisters friends sister bar tending there and this past sunday i said one the dumbest things. i had asked if her sister was single and whatnot, i pretty much just asked that in general because i thought my sister and hers where not friends anymore, i tried to say my bad and apologize but it was busy. though as i left she said in a joking way from what i could tell that she was going to tell her. i know it's not that bad sounding to most but i don't let stupid thoughts like that get out, i normally dismiss them and now i feel like the creepy guy.",asked about younger sisters friend to her older sister out of stupidity and i now feel like the creepy guy even though i believe she was giving me grief about telling her after i apologized.
40,"this actually happened yesterday.

i have a tendency to get really, really bored at work - because we have long periods of downtime. to keep myself awake i try to make myself physically uncomfortable. on my way in yesterday morning, i knew i had to drop a deuce, so i figured i'd hold it til after work to get me through the day.

it didn't help. about 10am, i'm staring at the clock waiting for my next task to be ready. a minute later my boss nudges my arm and tells me to go home and get some sleep - i had fallen asleep watching the clock.

so on the drive home, i'm annoyed at myself. i decide to stop by my parents house to pick up some cat6 i had left over there. as i pull off the highway i start coughing. the cough takes me hard (i'm recovering from a chest cold still) and i feel my asshole pinch for a minute, and an uncomfortable lump under me...i had coughed loose a small bit of dookie.

get to my parents and immediately bolt to the washroom. sure enough, little globules of crap clung to my underwear. 

so reddit, yesterday i fucked up.","yesterday, i held in my crap to stay awake, it didn't work, and after getting sent home from work i crapped myself in the car."
41,"first all, for those of you that don't know what headsooth is, it is a chapstick like device which you apply to your forehead when you have a headache, it gives a deep cold/burning sensation which isn't pleasant and the best of times.
 
so there we were, pre-drinking before a night out, having a right old laugh ect. when my mate pipes up to my other mate ""hey man, i dare you to put headsooth on your dick"" which he understandably refused. then an intoxicated me chirps in, ""i'll do it if you do"". the alcohol takes over and he agrees, putting the headsooth down his jeans. he then throws it to me, and as not one to back down from an agreement, i lathered that shit on. really pasted it. i finish and give it to the original 'darer', who is curious and gives it a go. 

next thing i know, the first guy screams 'fuck that' and runs upstairs.. no longer than 20 seconds later the slight tingling in my balls turned to a furious burning sensation, to which i ran upstairs in agony. i run to the nearest sink and pull out my manhood, and what do i see? my balls, shining like a beacon, red as a london bus. i hear a scream from downstairs, and the last guy runs upstairs screaming. so there we are, three guys, luckily with three sinks in separate rooms, washing our balls. the pain was unbearable, i thought i was going to pass out. it was a hybrid of burning/aching/stinging in the most sensitive of areas. i felt like i needed to piss, shit and just die all at once. so i walk out into the hall, the water on my balls doing nothing, and keel over half screaming and half laughing at the other two's screams. they're vigorously washing their balls and having as much luck as i am.

next thing i know my girlfriend and another mate come up stairs, he briskly takes a snapshot of my firey balls and decides to send them via whatsapp to everyone we know. i couldn't close my legs for a good hour after that.

 

edit: here's my balls http://i.imgur.com/isvybcm. nsfw, obviously. it's my fucking balls.","put headsooth on balls, searing pain followed"
42,"granted, this f-up is not too bad compared to many of the others here, but it is bad in my life. it actually occurred last thursday. my first class had been canceled, and i was running late for my other class. we were having a test in that class, so i wanted to get there on time. best way? to drive fast. keep in mind, i drive a 97 ford with a little 4 cylinder engine. pos, alright. i manage to get that thing to almost 50 mph in about a block and a half. didn't see the cop just off the road. then, to top it off, i didn't have current insurance cards. did i mention that it was a 25 mph zone? good news is, only got 195 for 20 over. took my word on the insurance problem..

 

also, don't hate too hard, first post on reddit...","my car accelerated the best it ever has, next to a cop, while late..."
43,"it's been a couple weeks since i'd been to the gym. i got sick, i started a new job, life was generally being shitty and in the way. after some gentle encouragement from my girlfriend, i agreed that i really did need to get back on it and go back to working out.

cue yesterday, first day back to the gym. i had lost my old lock but i had the one from my locker at my last job so i just brought that with me. i show up, get changed, and work out.

when i get done with my workout, i go back in the locker room, grab my soap, a towel, and underwear, lock my locker and go shower.

i finished my shower, walked out and up to my locker, and my heart sank. you can probably imagine why.

my old lock was a combination lock. the one from my locker at work was a key lock. my keys were inside my locker.

there i stood, wet, cold, and in my boxers, staring at my locker and the empty locker room and contemplating my next move.

after a few minutes alone in the locker room, i realized nobody else was going to be able to help me (because nobody else was in there), so i braved the journey from the locker room to the front desk.

here's where it gets worse -- the entire gym is one big room, with mirrors around the perimeter. if you're in the gym, people can see you. it was late, but not late enough that the gym was empty.

as an added bonus, the men's locker room is the room second furthest away from the front desk.

oh, and i should also mention that i am quite an, **ahem** *portly*, individual.

so i walked up to the front desk, damp and in my underwear, and faced the (unfortunately) female front desk attendant. as if my luck wasn't bad enough, now somebody from the other gender was the one i had to ask for help, in front of god and everybody, in my underwear.

much to my relief, the gym has a set of bolt cutters which she lent to me so i could go get my locker open. i trekked across the gym, now looking more ridiculous than before, in my underwear, holding a bolt cutter.

i made it back to my locker, cut the lock, got dressed and walked back up. i returned the bolt cutter and made it a priority to get the fuck outta there as fast as i could. hopefully nobody that's in there tonight was there last night, but chances are i won't get so lucky.","**i locked my keys in my locker, including the key for my lock. i then had to walk my fat ass up to the front desk, in my underwear, and ask the female front desk attendant for the bolt cutters so i could get my clothes, keys and everything else out.**"
44,"i did some nude photography/modeling a few years back, and while i love the pieces i did and do not regret them in the slightest, i don't particularly want seeing my friends, especially male friends, seeing me nude, mostly because i have *body issues* like every other woman it seems.

i was browsing reddit, and noticed a familiar photo. it was an old photo of me that someone had posted to gonewildplus, with another photo in the comments. i was surprised to see it and was having some feels about it. i was in chat with several people at once, bouncing between several different conversations, one of them being a good friend who i sent the link to the guys profile (but not the post itself), because she had something similar happen to her. however, when i was sending the link, i popped not into her box, but a box right next to her. a box with my male friend.

i immediately noticed my mistake, and though it wasn't a link to the direct post, i know that photo was only one click away, and it was the newest post. i profusely apologized and told him to please not open it. he conceded, and told me he even cleared the chat log so he wouldn't be tempted to open it. he also told me to thank my lucky stars that i must be special because he wouldn't ordinarily do that. and before you naysayers come in and say he did look at him, trust me, if he had he would have made some sort of ""nice tits"" joke.","almost sent a link containing a link of old nude photos to my friend, but he was a good buddy and didn't look."
45,"throwaway for obvious reasons, but i thought you guys might find more humor in what happened to me than i do.



today i've been feeling particularly horny. i think it's a combination of pms (which makes me want to have a dick inside me in the worst way), and just thinking about the incredible sex i had this past weekend. 



well, my boss was in a meeting all day today so i let the horny-ness get the best of me. i pulled up pictures of my boyfriend's dong and i knew i just had to slip my pants down to mid-thigh level and get to it.



i was really close to coming when i heard someone start walking up the stairs but i figured, fuck it, it *can't* be my boss..he's down in the meeting room all day! it has to be someone else going to their office. at that moment, i heard the door to my office open. fuuuuuck.



i quickly pulled my pants up, but he walked around the corner in time to see me doing some buttoning up. having been so close to orgasm, just the seam of the pants touching there made me come. as he's trying to talk to me acting like he didn't know what i had been doing.



as i tried my darndest to *not* show any signs of orgasm-occurence, i couldn't help my voice trembling. i could feel the flush color of my cheeks as well. but worst of all, i could see my boss getting a boner. my 68-year old boss turned on by my masturbation/orgasm. he then went into the bathroom for a few minutes, and we haven't exchanged words since the incident.



hello monday. this will be an awesomely awkward week at work.","boss walked in, i orgasmed, he got hard. pretty sure he fapped too."
46,"this will ^hopefully be the most disgusting, embarrassing thing that i will ever post. 

my mother in-law just got new , expensive chairs before the family visits for the holidays^you ^already  ^know ^where ^this ^is ^going
so my entire family is sitting around the house, and i am feeling 100% ok. i just put on some new sheer stockings and a long sweater that looks really cute. and i am sitting in one of the new chairs when i feel a little sture of nature encroaching upon my stink wrinkles. i think, ""ok cool, done this a million times, just push it up and let it out easy and no harm done"" 

but oh no, **ohhhh no**

instead of the dainty lady like poot i was expecting. i got a eruption that came forth from the debts of hell that was released into the world. the entire room fell completely and utterly quite as the loudest noise came from my anus, followed by a river of soupy shit. 
there was no hiding this .

the chair was white. 

my sweter was white. 

it was running down to the floor. 

and the smell could knock out a god damn moose.

they all are just looking at me, wide eyed and unmoving. they were like petrified stone . i was in complete shock as i tried to process what just happened. then it happened again. 

but this time, it came along with vomit. 

now despite all this, my family are very kind and understanding. my mother in law and my husband ran to me to help me , breaking from their state of horror and the rest of my family kind of left or did something to make it a little less embarrassing , but the damage is done.  i am just in my room, in my pajamas, scared to ever fart again...

and a 900$ chair is to never be seen again.",a river of the most ~~vial~~ **vile** shit you will ever witness erupted from me in front of my entire family.
47,"this is going to start like most of these with a ""this wasn't today but whatever"". just shut up, y'all want to here a good story. so, me and my two best mates are out in zante. first ever lads holiday. if you've seen the inbetweeners film, that was roughly our expectations. and it delivered. 

so i had never been sick from alcohol until the first night. zante changed that. apologies to megan, our rep, who received the blessing of my first ever tactical chunder. that's what you get when we arrive at 8:00 and we have dropped the bags and in a huge group on the way to the strip at 8:02. so yeah, shit had gone down, one mate nailed the grimmest effort of a girl in our whole resort and we carried on. 

fast forward to the third night, this is where i really fucked up. we waited fairly late to go out, plenty of predrinks, best digs on and ready for whatever the fuck that night would bring us. so we went slightly mad, laughing gas, headfuckers and erect nipples went down and down for a while. we followed the reps group and ended up in a bar/ club thing. at this point i was on the verge between loving it and cresting the peak. my confidence was huge, my banter and charm (i thought) was top notch and was chatting up some skirt. then my boys came over and told me that they entered my fucked ass in one of the drinking games. and, in case you have never been on this type of holiday before, that's code for torture involving alcohol. 

so it's me versus this girl, and i'm genuinely struggling to comprehend the instructions from the rep over the huge pa system in the club, but there is a load of drinks on a tray to the side and a barstool in front of me. that's what a state i was already.  i knew this was bad. so the idea was (from my memory), shot of vodka 10 spins around the bar stool, 10 push ups, 10 star jumps and there was 4 shots. then the same thing but with a pint (!) of sex on the beach. shit son. did this in a completely retarded fashion, then we had to find 10 members of the opposite sex to kiss and run back. done. some of the girls even volunteered, but most, i sort of just grabbed their face. then another shot of vod and one last excersize round. whoah nelly. 

as we got to the final big club where a dj was playing, i was totally hating it. felt just awful, could not control myself and i wanted out of this drunken stupor. my buddies paid for me to go to the vip lounge so i could sit down. sat down for maybe one or two minutes. could not handle it. the music, the room spin, jesus this is awful. ran outside. projectile paint job on a car parked outside the club. sat on the curb and vomited some more all over myself and the car. passed out. loads of people tyres to wake me up, apparently. would not move. i went to a place then that i never want to go to again. if i had a gun, i would have shot myself immediately. and i'm very much not suicidal. i wanted out. i wanted to die if it stopped my being this goddamn drunk. wanted to cry. saw an ambulance pulling up. got in. 

woke up in the middle of the night on a drip, doctors and nurses standing around me. was on a drip. went back to sleep just to get out of this nightmare. i could not face reality. 

woke up the next morning, no headache and far more sober, still with the drip attached. found my way to the hospital toilet, trailing the drip behind. found something else down there too (reset the counter everyone). yup. had done that overnight at some point. at this point i was just greatfull to be alive and not drunk. 

to shorten this part up, i chatted to the nurses and they basically said i owed about €500. as luck would have it i paid for travel insurance and the nurses said that we would agree to say i just had a stomach bug from the water, otherwise if there is alcohol involved they won't pay.  

this ended with me banging on the door of my bros hotel room. tears of joy in their eyes, all i could say was, ""i need travel insurance, hotel documents and out flight ticket home"". those words are now legend amongst us. 

that's my tale. sorry if i wrote it like shit of if it was boring. it was one of the worst moments of my life, no actually the worst (i have had a lucky life so far in terms of relatives passing etc). and if someone can get a laugh out of it and/or learn from it, then it wasn't such a waste of time.","i don't blame you, that was one hell of a wall of text. got so fucked up on first ever lads holiday, ended up in the hospital on a drip. and in zante, there's not nhs like here in blighty. £££"
48,"so today i had two exam finals and, i believed, a paper final due tomorrow. then i would be done or, so i thought. i had recently passed a macroeconomics course i had failed the last semester so i thought everything was golden. 

today i drag myself out of bed after studying all night for my 7:30am final, go home, study some more for my 1:30pm final and head off to class. i get to my 1:30pm final and begin talking to the guy who sits next to me...who just happens to be in my class with the paper final i thought was due tomorrow. 

some friends of mine come in and as we're talking i let it slip i have a paper i need to write for tomorrow. the guy i was talking to before interjects and with a look of pity informs me that our paper final was due today. i immidately panic and type out an email to my professor in hopes he takes pity on me. 

th problem is, i've had him for two other classes and the one time he will not take a late paper is the final exam. so, i effectively have failed a class with my favorite professor. also, i am part of a new sorority forming on campus but my gpa for the semester has to be over a 2.0. 

 

edit: i also almost got hit by a car twice today. 

update:
my professor answered the very apologetic email with a ""these things happen. have a good break!"" which pretty much means that i'm in trouble with my grade now. i have got all my other class grades reported except him. i'm just waiting for the damage but i've already accepted the worst.","i passed a course i failed last semester, thought i was going to do well for the rest of finals. i missed the deadline for a final paper. now i'm going to fail this class and not get initiated into the first year of sisters for a new sorority on campus."
49,"this actually happened a while ago, but so did everything else on this sub. this fuck up happened whilst i was still in highschool. i lived very far away from my highschool, so during my senior year i lived with my grandmother to save money on petrol. as you can imagine, my grandmother is not an avid user of the internet, but i am. i implored her to change to a shaped plan. a shaped plan is where instead of charging you extra when you go over your data allowance, they slow your throughput with no further charges.

she refused, because technology is scary. if she had just taken my advice, i wouldn't be writing this post. highschool was a very frustrating time for me; i grew hair where there was no hair before, and i felt the urges that all teenage boys feel. my room had a computer in it, and i consistently went over our data allowance with pornography every single month that i lived with my grandmother. since the allowance was so restrictive, i chose to download and store all of the porn videos locally for later use, in a single folder called something along the lines of ""biology homework,"" because teenagers like to think that they're clever when they're really not. i even cleared the browser history, because obviously i did.

frustrated, (but in a different, angrier way) my grandmother called her isp to dispute a huge bill that my penis had accrued (*.. ladies*). the isp emailed her my download history, which included a lot of visits to various tube-porn sites. my grandmother, not fully understanding that her 'download limit' encompasses page views as well as downloaded files, decided to search through all of my folders, and yes, she found lots and lots of my dirty, **dirty** porn.

now, my grandmother isn't stupid. obviously a teenage boy is going to look at internet porn. she opened one of the aforementioned locally stored videos. she was not prepared for what she saw. my grandmother was married at 19, so she hasn't exactly been around the block. what she saw was in an entirely different suburb. when i got home from school she confronted me. i owned up to everything, because i didn't think that it was that big of a deal, but i moved back home anyway because my grandmother couldn't deal with the monetary cost of my habits.",i watched so much porn whilst living with my grandmother that she kicked me out. also she found my porn-stash and was disgusted.**
50,"this didn't happen today, but i need to tell the world.  here's the backstory:

a little while back, i was having a conversation with a friend of mine about what would be the worst thing to get beaten up with.  we quickly settled on a dildo.  just imagine getting into a fight and, instead of a knife, the guy pulls an enormous dildo and beats the ever loving piss out of you with it.  emasculating and painful.  so needless to say, i quickly went off to romantic depot with a few friends to purchase a dildo so i could then go around getting into drunken fights all night.

i was able to procure a quite wonderful 16 inch black double ended dildo.  it was perfect: fit nicely in the hand, heavy enough to leave a welt, and just wiggly enough to provide a good smacking.  we went and got drunk and immediately started wandering around my college campus antagonizing everyone we could find at which point i would pull the dildo out from my inside jacket pocket and start whacking people with it.  pretty much everyone found it hilarious and a few people posed for pictures.

as time went on, i began to use the dildo less and less and eventually threw it into the trunk of my car where i would bring it out only on special occasions.  a special occasion being, let's say, sitting awkwardly next to someone at a red light in the middle of the night and needing a prop to play with until they look over and i can make horrible eye contact with them (quick aside: i drive a hatchback, so the dildo could be accessed quickly by a passenger when the moment called for said dildo).

eventually, the dildo fell out of use and i became accustomed to the sound of it rolling around in the trunk.  every time i accelerated i could hear it roll to the back and thud against the door, every time i braked i could hear it roll forward and thud against the seats.  people would ask,""what's that sound?"" to which i would reply, ""oh, that's just my dildo.""  eventually, i got tired of explaining the story of the dildo to people and threw it in a messenger bag that remained in my trunk.

some time passes

i woke up one morning and as i was eating breakfast, my dad came into the kitchen and told me he had taken my car to the car wash.  he had wanted them to vacuum inside so he cleaned everything out.  all of the things that had been in my car were on the side of the garage.  i went out to the garage and found all of the crap that had piled up in the car stacked neatly against the wall.  i started loading everything back in the car when i remembered the dildo in the messenger bag.  i opened the bag.  there was no dildo.

i searched and searched and could not find the dildo.  there can only be one explanation.  and my dad hasn't said anything.  and it's been a little while now and he still hasn't brought it up.  and i'll never say anything either.

but until the day he dies, my father will know that his son, at one point in time, owned a sixteen inch double ended floppy black dildo.  and he will never know why.",i bought a dildo and my dad found it and we aren't talking about it
51,"so this isn't a 1 day fuck up but instead several weeks worth.

i am going to be brief with certain events here because i made a promise to z not to tell anyone what happened and as you will soon understand, it is safer if it just stays hidden. for the same reasons, i have used a thowaway.

a few weeks ago i got a call from a particularly drunken and high z who wanted to do themselves in so i spent that night making sure they were okay. despite some very weird goings on where they were angrily responding to comments that no one had said. due to their unhealthy state.

after that night, everything was perfectly fine until 3 weeks later when this sentence was said ""i will always appreciate you. you are one of the best people i know... i fucking hate you! you are a prick. i hope you die!"" and they ran off. now nothing happened between the two things and i hadn't even had a chance to respond to the first comment.

over the next few days people started learning why she suddenly hated me. when i eventually found out what the story is, i can assure you that it is a very alternative take on what i did that evening. but it does tie in with the ""weird goings on"" i mentioned. now because of the way they have been acting it would appear that they believe this completely so i just tried to ignore everything as much as possible and leave it alone. but after a few too many comments, i said ""i am not going to go into what happened but you can guarantee it didn't happen that way. i don't know why they are saying it, maybe it is because of the alcohol."" i decided not go into the details because i know that that would be better for z. and i am beginning to realise that i can handle this better than they would.

well this got back to z didn't it. now z, along with family and friends is wanting to finish me off for chatting shit.","so from what i can understand, if people chat shit about me, i have to pretend it is fact because any form of defending myself just results in death threats."
52,"the nofap community recommended i post this to r/tifu

###how r/nofap ruined my only chance at a potential relationship 
    

a couple months ago, i went on a 2nd date with a girl from okcupid. originally we planned to go snowtubing but the snow had melt. instead she invites me over for dinner. i get there, it's just us and it’s going really good. but then, her roommate and his mom shows up. we all hang out and play board games. now her roommate’s mom is really hot, (and since i was 21 days nofap) i decide to playfully flirt with the mom. the mom is totally into it. it gets late though, and she eventually leaves. it's only me, my date and her roommate left. i suppose her roommate didn't enjoyed me flirting with his mom because i was cock-blocked the rest of the night. 
    

at about 12:30am, we're all very tired and the roommate asks if i'm going to spend the night, (*awkward*). so, they set me up in the ""guest loft"" which is an alcove/cubby about 6 feet off the ground right next to this girls room. i'm so exhausted that i just crash instead of waiting up for her to finish brushing her teeth (i should have waited). i’m asleep in this guest loft, right next to this girl's room and i start having crazy sexual dreams. one of the dreams is so intensely sexual that i wake up right away realizing something bad. i look down and see that i justed blasted about 21 days worth of jizz into my underwear (wet dream).
    

i think “holy fuck this is bad - you can't get invited to a girls house and then jizz all over her guest room bed.” i'm freaking out, perhaps i should just run out to my car, leave and never return. i don't know what else to do. so i decide that is my plan. it’s really cold outside and i remember that my sweatshirt is on the floor next to the bed. so i lean over the bed head-first to grab my sweatshirt... except, i totally forgot that i’m in a loft. i end up diving head first down a 6 foot drop.
    

at the last moment, i catch myself on a panel of wood and cabinet. unfortunately i break both of them, cracking the wall and causing a giant banging sound. now i'm fucked, i just jizzed all over the place broke her cabinet and the wall, everyone must have heard it! so i run to the bathroom in my sticky underwear while carrying my jeans. finally some good luck. it’s looks as if all the jizz stayed in my underwear. but now i have to figure out what to do with a destroyed pair of underwear. do i try to hide it somewhere? where? they must have heard the crash. they are probably right outside looking to see what happened. i quickly ball up the underwear and shove it down my pants. i go back to the bed and no one is there?!. i look around for jizz evidence. i can't find any, but its dark (i'm like 90% sure that it all stayed in my underwear!) now my only concern is the smell. i mean, c'mon it's 21 days’ worth of cum. and, she's sleeping, at most,  15 ft away in her room.
    

anyways, i start to get tired, think *screw it* (she lived 45 min away, it's not like it was a coworker and i would be permanent known as the creep who masturbates all over your guest room while you sleep). so i laydown and fall back asleep. i wake up to sounds of the girl moving around the house. she goes downstairs, so i have quickly make the bed while looking for any cum stains (i didn't see any!). i put all my clothes on while she comes back up the stairs. she jokes about how i'm trying to break her house into pieces. all of a sudden, in slowmotion, i see her nostrils flair. she is starting to smell the jizz! i quickly make some excuse about having to grab some mouthwash from my car. i run out to the and secretly pull the underwear out of my pants and stash it. now, i made it thus far. i decide to push my luck,  i come back into the house and we hang out for like 2 hours, nothing awkward at all. 

i spent all the next day waiting for a text message: ""did you cum all over the guest loft?""","21 days nofap, i go on my first date in over a year. i spend the night and paint the guest room."
53,"well, it's more of a 6 month slow-mo fuck up. the girl i love & who loved me was in the midst of the toughest 2 years anyone has gone through. i got so scared of my own shadow, constantly afraid of saying the wrong thing that might add more stress to her life, that i barely said anything. that didn't help at all. so despite doing everything i could think of to keep our relationship strong, she lost many of those feelings for me. she needed to rip off some band aids to take back control of her own life, and i was one of those band aids. think it's painful when you rip off a band aid? well, imagine what it feels like to be the band aid.",wasn't honest with my gf and she dumped me.
54,"i woke up this morning, somewhat hungover after a(nother) night of heavy drinking. it was about 1pm and time for lunch, so i went to the kitchen. i live at home and my stepmom was making lunch. she said ""spillomanen, if i make us some wraps, then you make us something to drink"" and who could possibly say no to such an offer? i grab a water bottle for our sodastream machine, and poured the elderflower and apple syrup into the water, no biggie. 

i attached the water bottle (with syrup in it) to the sodastream, and pushed to button to fill it with carbon dioxide. and then it all went to hell. the pressure in the water bottle became way too high in a matter of seconds. gas and soda was being forced out of the sodastream, spraying everything in a radius of 40cm. a mix of being kind of stunned by this unforseen event and my brain still not working properly , i thought ""i gotta release the bottle from the machine, that will end it all!"" as that seemed like the only reasonable thing to do. i grabbed the bottle and loosened it from the sodastream. an explosion of elderflower soda sprayed everything in an even greater radius than before, and then everything became quiet. i stood still for a couple of seconds, trying to come to terms with what the hell just happend. and i realized i reversed the process of making this damn soda. carbon dioxide, then syrup. i spend the next 15 minutes wiping down the kitchen, while my stepmom was laughing at me.",making soda is hard with a hangover
55,"happened a few quarters ago, sorry i only discovered this place recently. i was in a helping relationship psychology class where we were given a task to practice one on one relationships with people who had small and manageable problems. we were assigned to record our sessions so our professor could check on our responses and tell us how to better work on our methods. the file was a little large so i put the recording on a usb stick i got freshman year. i wiped it clear on my pc and checked to make sure that nothing was on it. i turned it in and thought little of it. 

i got called into her office the next week. i walked in pretty casually awaiting my feedback. she tells me to take a seat and goes: ""well, first of all, your file didn't work (she tried to open it with itunes i think and the audio file wasn't compatible), but more importantly, i have to ask you something. were you aware that your usb is named 'horse porn'? i'm not sure i want to open that file anyways, care to explain yourself?"" 

**shit**

flashback to freshman year. i used the same usb stick to pass music and shows between my roommate and i. as it turns out, he changed the name of my usb stick on his mac, which for whatever reason wasn't visible on pc. although i took all the files off, the name remained until my professor stumble upon it expecting my assignment. 

anyways i had the opportunity of explaining this to my professor as she laughed her ass of at how flustered i was and how many times i apologized. she also made me tell the story the next class, and that's what i am currently known for within my major as far as i know.","forgot to wipe usb stick name, handed my prof. what she thought was my horse porn collection"
56,"a few months ago i was at my girlfriends house and we went into the garage to get something to drink while we watched netflix. well while we were in there she was being frisky then started giving me a blowjob when we heard her mom out in the kitchen. we quickly grabbed some sodas and walked out. i still had my boner so i stayed a bit behind to adjust it and make it less noticeable. i was in the hallway looking at a mirror and flipped it up in my shorts and unbeknownst to me, her mom was in the part of the kitchen next to her and could see me. apparently she saw my penis and muttered, ""oh my.."" and kinda walked away into her room without saying anything else. i didn't know anything until my girlfriend told me after that her mom saw half of my penis.","got a boner and tried to hide it when we heard her mom, her mom ended up seeing it and just walked into her room."
57,"i'm a children's librarian in a small town where everyone seems to know each other. part of my job is working with our volunteers. a very nice girl (about 14) started volunteering a couple of weeks ago. one of my co-workers knows her family and we were talking about her before her shift one day. turns out this girl is from a wealthy family, is extremely popular, all the normal things that makes me regress into my old angsty ""i hate pretty girls"" mentality. this girl is actually really nice and very interested in library work so i put away my stupid baggage and continue to be encouraging to her. 

one day during a lull we start talking about our families (just basic 'do you have any brothers or sisters?' kind of stuff) she starts talking about her brothers and how they don't get along. i share my experience with my family and tell her 'you know, things may seem bad now but when you get older and move out of your parents house you're going to miss your brothers and parents. all of the little fights you have turn into funny stories. so just try to enjoy the time you get to spend under the same roof with your brothers."" and then i say ""as long as nothing really bad happens to you or your family i'm sure you'll look back favorably on your time together."" she responds with ""3 years ago my dad gave up on life.""

59,"since i was about 10, i've had really bad acne and ultra sensitive skin, but it wasn't until a today (headed into my sophomore year in high school) that my parents decided i should get epiduo prescription medication for my face. i've tried all kinds of medication in the past and they didn't work, but my parents saw a commercial on the tv and got themselves all excited. i went to the dermatologist and she prescribed epiduo, which turns out to be an insanely overpriced version of neutrogena. i left the doctor's and went to walgreen's to get my new fancy $200 goop. i headed home, took a shower, put on the new medication, and headed out to my golf lesson. it's a sunny, hot day, probably around 90, with no real shade because i'm on a golf course. after about 20 minutes of being in the sun, i started to notice my skin feeling a little tight and dry, but i brushed it off because that sometimes happens with new medication. as more time passed, it started to really burn. by the time my lesson was finally over, it felt like satan was taking a shit on my face. i rushed home and stuck my head in the sink, hoping it would quench the fire erupting on my face. boy was i wrong. the water just made it worse, if that was possible. warm water was a little better, but at that time i was just trying to get the rest of the epiduo off, if there was any left. while running warm water over my face, i decided to read the bottle of that evil goop. it says not to mix with other medications, and to be careful of using it while in sunlight. not only was i outside for an hour an a half in blazing sun, i use at least 3 other types of prescription medication. guess my dermatologist just... forgot... to warn me. its been two hours since my golf lesson and my skin is just staring to cool off. i just looked in the mirror and it looks like i've been severely sunburned and my skin is ""shedding"".i probably wont be using epiduo, or ever going outside again.",used prescription medication and  spent two hours in the sun when it directly told me not to.
60,"bit of back story: my boyfriend, ""j"", lives in an a one bedroom apartment with a currently unemployed roommate who made a makeshift bedroom where the dining room should be. his roommate,""w"", gets money from his parents to pay rent/bills so he hardly ever leaves.

important to note: he has a dresser with a huge mirror that is angled to see directly into j' room.

well, earlier today, j and i were laying around watching netflix. w tells j that he'll be at his parents for a few hours to hang out and get his rent money. he leaves, so j and i decide ""fuck it! we're alone, time for some hot shower sex!"". about 15 minutes into our romp, i thought i heard a noise but just figured it was either the upstairs neighbor or someone doing something outside. i forget about it and keep going. j loves to hear me yell ""fuck me!"". it is his go to to let go and get off. so i enthusiastically shout it a couple of times. i came, he came it was awesome.

we get out of the shower and i only had my pants in the bathroom because i got half undressed in his room. so, since we were home alone and all, i just walked out with nothing on on top. while i was in his room looking for my shirt and bra, with the door wide open, j's phone goes off. it's w saying hes got mail on the stove. which i thought was strange since he would've told him before he left. j walks into the room, sees the text and messages him back.

that's when we heard w's phone go off. 

j went to see if w was there or if he had just left his phone behind. turns out he only went over there for maybe 5 minutes before coming back and laying in bed, facing the mirror. he swears up and down he didn't know we were in there and he didn't see/hear anything but he won't look me in the eye. that pretty much confirms to me that hes seen my tits. 

i do not look forward to the awkwardness between us for the next couple of weeks.",boyfriend and i had sex in shower without realizing roommate came back home. he probably saw my tits in the process.
61,"so a little background. i work in a manufacturing plant and today my job was to run parts out of our automatic press. well i loaded a coil of stock onto the  feeder.

first fu: i didn't pay attention to which way the burr was facing on the coil.

now this doesn't seem important but when you run it through the straightner it affects the way the stock is flattened. so this is where the second fu comes in.

second fu: i only used to banding straps instead of three.

well again doesn't seem like much but that third band keeps the material from twisting while coiled up. well as soon as i tried to move it it shifted and turned into [this]( http://i.imgur.com/r1z6ssf.jpg). now i can't just scrap it cause it's a 2000ft coil that costs about $1200. so i have to rewind the coil... by hand.

62,"sister's going out of town and taking her kids. ""hey little brother, do you mind staying at my place a couple days and taking care of the pets?""


it's not a problem. the first part of the afternoon yesterday i got bored and rearranged the alphabet letters on her refrigerator into various immature phrases and vulgarities. ""love gay anal, suck the quick stick, etc"" - but the potential for the perverse is limited with having only a few dozen letters. 


ah! i'll call the gf over to stay the night. now all this has been ok'd through my sister, who assured me all the beds had clean sheets and we could take our pick where we slept. well, sister has the biggest bed - let's sleep in her room!

after a night of passionate nosex, the gf make a joke about the 'bullet' on my sister's dresser. i glance over and sure enough it looks like one of those sex toys. ""haha, it does favor that, doesn't it? however, naive and silly gf, that's lipstick. i've deducted that because its sitting right next to the rest of her makeup. here, i'll show you."" with that, i reach over and pop the cap of the lipstick container. maybe it wasn't maybelline, because batteries fell out. 

""oh no...  no nono. i made a terrible mistake."" *this actually is my sister's pocket rocket.* i yelp, drop it, and jump back. then the heavy realization to make it worse, i have to pick it up and put it back together... lest i look like i tried to use it.","thanks to my quick reasoning and faster reactions, i grabbed my sister's tiny dildo."
63,"so here's my story, happened just 15 minutes ago.
i just got back from the gym and had a shower. i decided to snap a pic of myself to send to the gf and also just as a general progress pic. so anyway, here's where the fuck up happens. as i opened the picture, i pressed this one button which i assumed was the ""share"" button. once clicked, nothing happened. i admit at this point i had no clue what just happened so i shrugged it off. i was able to press the correct button and send it to the gf.

however! as i'm getting changed and heading down to grab some food, i start hearing my mum yelling at me very loudly. i have nfi what this could be about, cos she usually nags me like this, but not this loudly. at this point i just want to add that i have traditional indian conservative parents. as i'm walking down, she starts asking me what i was doing in the bathroom, and why there's a naked selfie of me currently on their 48"" tv.

at this point i start trying to explain (half fucking shocked) that i was trying to take progress pics and it was an accident. eventually after me repeating that same line over and over, she lets it go. she then goes on to tell me how both her and my dad were watching tv when my picture suddenly appeared. i burst into laughter and could not stop laughing as i walked back up the stairs to my room. hopefully everything won't be so awkward, though i'm wishing now that i had one of those neuralizers from men in black to end my humiliation and embarrassment.

embarrassing but also pure hilarity.","took a naked selfie for the gf and for ""progress pics"", end up accidentally sharing it onto the big screen tv downstairs which my parents were viewing. tifu."
64,"this actually happened last weekend, and i feel that i need to preface that i am a 28 year old female and i have camped many times, but i always make sure to have a potty nearby because my biggest fear is what happened. 

i live in idaho and it's been 100 degrees every day for like a month and a half. some friends and i decide to go down to the river and hang out, play with the dogs, whatever. before we left i kinda had to poo but i couldn't do it, it was more of a ""i'm gonna have to go eventually"" kind of thing. 

so we go to a part of the river that i've never been to, you have to walk some trails to get down there. so we get there and i jump in right away cause i've had to pee forever and it's the river, that's what you do. about 7 minutes after that i realize that i have to go. i think to myself that i can hold it, i just have to get out of the water for a bit. so i go sit down and realize this is not one of those moments, this is a monster that has to get out of me. 

so i get out of the water and start walking back towards the trails. one of my friends asks where i'm going an i have to go so bad i just say ""illberightback!"" as fast as possible, cause losing focus on this means i will for sure have feces in my swimsuit.

i get back to the main trail and start walking along, trying to find a place where there is a log or something that i can squat over that is also not in the view of people, but it gets so bad that i just said ""fuck it"" and found the closest log available. i am so lucky that there happens to be a whole dug already, so all i have to do is squat down and sit on the log.
 
this is where the problem occurs. i have a soaking wet swimsuit on, that is a pain in the ass to get off, and when i get down ready to go, i panic. my butt is like ""nope nope nope"" when it touches the log and i panic. so while my body was ready to free this beast, my brain was like ""abort!""

so it starts to go and i am stuck in this almost kneeling position on the ground and i don't know what to do cause i can't stop myself from pooping. so i just let it go, and i lost my balance and ended up shatting on my foot. it was warm and as disgusting as you could imagine. i was annoyed and grossed out and panicky at that moment, but nothing prepared me for what came next: i had nothing to wipe with. i look around for leaves or a stick or something, anything to end this, and then i start to think ""what if those leaves are poisonous? what if the stick gives me splinters? i don't want splinters in my butthole."" 

luckily i happen to have a shirt on over my swimsuit, so i begrudgingly take it off and wipe myself with it. i then threw it in the whole, and buried the entire remnants of the horrific situation at hand. 
then i had the matter of getting the poo off me. instead of going back and facing my friends, i walked further down the trail to find a place more secluded than where we were. i hope in the river and start washing myself off as best as i can and i glance up and there is a fly fisherman about 25 feet away from me. i see him and he turns around like ""wtf are you doing?"" so i nod and proceed to rinse myself off as quickly as possible. 

i then went back to where my friends were and proceeded to tell them my story. they all laughed and told me i was riding on top of the car on the way back.",i am a grown professional female who doesn't know how to shit in the woods.

the hall i was working in doesn't have a restroom, and the nearest one is right around the hall corner. i leave my music plugged in to the speaker and go off to relieve myself. all is fine in the restroom, but stepping into the hall i quickly realized my mistake; [killing in the name of](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwxazvhlyxq) was playing and blaring loud ""fuck you""s throughout the halls. i fumbled around with the speakers, grabbed my ipod, and went off to hide in shame from everyone else.","told some more senior workers to ""fuck you, i won't do what you tell me."""

67,"its a summer day and being a 16 year old female enjoying the days of being home alone, i decide to put my favorite broadway soundtrack *chicago* on. i hop in the shower to enjoy the jazzy tunes (because, who doesn't like to sing in the shower) and i don't bother to close the bathroom door because i'm home alone right? getting out to dry off when my favorite, ""when your good to mama"" is on. 
for those of you who don't know *chicago* very well, ""when you're good to mama"" is very sudctive if sang/danced right. so i feel hot when i sing this song and began to dry off in a senutal mannor, i put my leg up on the closed toilet seat and having a little sexy time in the mirror to see what i look like if i ever get a boyfriend and i do my little number when i turn my head to see-...
my uncle, starting down the hallway. gets a glance of my sexy-nakedness through the wide open door and my towel only covering one boob. he dives down the stairs and i grab my towel, turn off the music and shamefully dry myself off like a normal person, got dressed, and came out to the computer where i write my story of shame.","did a sexy towel dance in the mirror after my shower with the door wide open to the *chicago* song ""when you're good to mama"" thinking i was home alone, but, my uncle saw it all."
68,"this actually happened a long time ago and is actually one of my earliest memories of throwing up.  when i was about eight i was at a party in my neighborhood when my stomach started to act up.  i decided to walk home to go to the bathroom because i thought i needed to poop.  i made it to my bathroom but nothing was conning out.  after straining to push something out for a good 5 minuets, my face suddenly explodes with vomit.  i end up soaking a rug in my bathroom and covering the floor with my puke.  i think the only reason i remember this is because it was the first time vomit ever came out my nose an it hurt like a bitch.","how are you this lazy?  it's a single paragraph, read it!"
69,"this was actually about 4 years ago, but i think it qualifies as a fuck up. so anyway, i was sick with the flu or something, i had been home sick for a good week. i go to the bathroom to puke. what happened next, was pretty much one of the dumbest things i have done. i was trying to puke into the toilet since i felt like i had to puke, but i also felt a fart coming on. now i thought it was just a fart, wrong. i ended up shitting into my pajama pants right there on the floor. to make it worse, i can't seem to remember puking, so it could have been fucking avoided. 

i then got into the shower and cleaned up, twice.","fuck you, read."
70,"i was at my grandparents' farm today just walking around when i stumbled across a blue egg just sitting on the ground. it actually looked whole, but when i picked it up, i noticed it had a few holes in it where the unborn bird must have leaked out. it still had some weight to it though, so i figured that i could just take it home and rinse it out and keep it and it would be a cool thing to have! 

no. 

i went to my car to put it in there where i wouldn't forget it. i had my other hand full of stuff, so i used the hand holding the robin egg to open my car door. 

*crunch*

fuck. i looked down at the egg and then realized that a very dark brown liquid had leaked out onto my hand. keep in mind that it is in the 90 degree range here in iowa with a bright sun too. this thing was rotten. so, that's the story of how my hand smelled like death for a day. i washed it off but i don't think i'll ever forget that smell...",accidentally broke a rotten robin's egg into my hand. will never forget the smell.
71,"i work at a chain restaurant and lately we have had a lot of ""coupon fraud."" basically, this means servers steal stacks of coupons or print them from their computer under false emails (or snatch them out of local newspapers but this is more rare) and add them to all their cash checks. since they are their ""own bank"" and don't pay the restaurant until the end of the night, those coupons that were never really used when someone gives them cash and says keep the change end up being an extra five, ten, whatever dollars in their pocket... sometimes costing us hundreds and hundreds of dollars in losses, impacting manager salaries and bonuses, and also impacting even other hourly employees who are on the upper end of the ladder trying to move up.

i found out this mass coupon fraud was going on, and i ""checked in"" a friend to her shift. not super close, but i've been to her house and drank after work and never had any problems with her. she seemed like a pretty cool chick. i had suggested we search all of the servers' books for coupons, so i was searching them all. i flipped hers open when she set it down when she walked in, and unfortunately, there was a stack of coupons in there... which should be impossible as all coupons actually used are to be turned in at the end of the night, and any that are found are to be turned in and destroyed immediately. basically, if you have a big stack like that, it means you are planning to steal.

there were so many witnesses that i couldn't have covered for her even if  i wished to do so. another girl got shooed out the door, and as a 'key holder' type position, i cannot show any preferential treatment, especially if i am to be moved into management like i plan.

i honestly had no idea she was one of the people stealing. she was suspended for a few days and fired today. i don't know if she will be able to even keep her apartment after this, and that's a pretty shitty feeling to know that you did to a cool person, even if they did make the choice themselves.","got a cool chick i had no problems with fired because she was profiting from coupon fraud. feels bad, man."
72,"so, this was actually a week ago on canada day, and i guess its more of a really awkward situation than anything else. anyway, it's canada day, and i don't usually bus, but its free today. take the bus downtown with some friends, have a great time. we split, i go to a teammates house for a bit then bus home alone, around 11:30. 

the bus was packed and i barely squeezed on. the next stop a couple of chubby and unattractive women who are over twice my age get on the bus (i'm 18). they also squeeze in, pushing me against a wall. i'm sorta standing there with one of the women up against me. my phone is in sorta in a weird position,(sometimes i put my phone in my pocket sideways and it sorta sticks out) and i can't grab it to get it flat in my pocket since the woman's ass is basically on my leg. so i brilliantly decide to rub my leg, with my phone pointed out against her to get it flat in my pocket. you can probably guess what she thought, that i had basically rubbed my erect dick against her. she sorta twitches but there's no room to move, my phone with its pretty hard case stays up against her for another 5 or 6 minutes before she gets off. when she does get off, i can't stop myself from glancing at her face to see if she was thinking what i thought she was thinking. she glares at me with disgust and i immediately turn away. i know i'll never see her or her friends again, but it was a really awkward bus ride, not only cause of the phone thing, butt because i was stuck against a chubby woman who was like 45+ for like 6 minutes. i'm also very allergic to perfume, no more busing for me.","rubbed my phone in my pocket against a much older woman's ass in a crowded bus, made her think i basically humped her"

well i was going to pick up my friend to go see a local concert so i go to text him i am in front of his house. his name is mason. i jokingly type, ""prepare your anus, i'm coming in hot"" to let him know. i instinctively type ""ma"" into my shitty samsung phone which goes to the first name starting with ""ma."" mari comes before mason in the alphabet. until a week ago mason was the only ""ma"" in my phone. i completely forget that i had added mari. only when i saw ""message sent to mari"" had i realized what i had done. i held down my car horn in rage, and then the police came because i was causing a noise disturbance. so on to of the rapey text i got fined $50 and couldn't go to the concert.

 

p.s. samsung is crap

edit: she didn't text me back for a day until finally she sent me basically, ""what the shit."" i attempted to convince her that her english wasn't good enough and that she misread it. wrong thing to do. so she took her phone to her friends and parents to make sure that she didn't misread it. so now i appear to be a serial rapist to her friends. and then her parents. when they found out and i had a 15 minute conversation with a portuguese mother, using profanity in two languages. i am no longer her tutor and grounded.

so i'm 14 and discovered masturbation a few months ago - this is to be expected of people to start watching porn and stuff. i had a soundcloud account linked to my facebook, and started listening to some porn to get me off. it normally helps me.

so since it's linked, i start listening to some of that shit. i start masturbating, and then i get a call from my mom. pause, stop, answer.

""hello?""

""hi, _. i saw on your facebook you're watching _""

*me, being in total and utter shock* ""um, what?""

""it says you were watching _ on facebook.""

""oh...it does?"" i start denying everything.

i then tell my mom i'll do something, hang up, and delete my account, hoping that the info will disappear. 

now here is my favorite part. i call my mom back and explain to her i deleted my account (which i never even used), and she says it's okay for boys my age to explore sexual content. she was okay with it.

but it was still super awkward nonetheless. i appreciate how my mom knows it's okay, and that it's normal and doesn't mind.

77,"this one is pretty cut and dry...

work in a very small office. when one uses the bathroom there is no question about whether it is 1 or 2. thought since nobody was upstairs that i had clearance to let one rip. i immediately regretted that decision. a faster than usual dash to the bathroom probably alerted everyone downstairs that there was something amiss. as soon as i sat down on the toilet i reached for the tp so i could check the damage... 3 fucking squares left...3. results from the first one indicated that this was going to be a fucking mess so i did what i had to do - folded that bitch in half and used it twice. every square inch of clean white paper was going to be needed if i was going to get out of this without having to go home for lunch. by some miracle the last square indicated a clean surface but by this time i had been in there way longer than a #1. so nobody used the bathroom the rest of the day and i had to go downstairs and get more tp out of the closet in front of everyone just to put to rest any doubt in their minds as to whether or not pooping was going on. little did they know....",never trust a fart at work. it may work once or twice but eventually you will shart and when you do there will not be any tp for you. because life.
78,"i, 22f, am studying abroad in argentina this semester. as i am well aware, the country is currently in a state of economic distress and, as the unemployment rate is extremely high, many of the inhabitants have resorted to petty crime, such as pickpocketing, in an attempt to make ends meet. there's the background.

a few days ago (today i didn't fuck up.. but i sure did on saturday morning) i was leaving a guy's apartment after he had already left to go to work. i get myself all ready to go and see half of the joint we had smoke from the night before sitting in the ashtray on the table. i have nothing else really to do the rest of the day so i decide to take a few puffs. feeling nice and buzzed, i put my iphone headphones in my hears, turned on my music and went along my way. after realizing the commute home would have been a 1.5 hour long walk i decide to wait at the 124 bus stop. there were trucks parked in the spaces in front of the stop so it was difficult to see the bus and to consequently hail it down. the woman in front kept walking into the street to see if the bus was coming, so i figured i'd leave that to her in order to eventually get on the bus. this was my first mistake, being completely still giving my assailants time to scope me out. a few minutes later a man comes up to me and mentions i have a stain on my back and that i should clean it. i feel around my coat and find nothing, so i continue in my trance from the playlist and the sunny day and the weed and the waiting. then another woman comes up and again mentions that there's something on my back. at this point i start to feel around my shoulders and when i pull my hand back i see that there is a huge glob of saliva on my skin. there are several trails of spit on my clothes. fucking gross. i also didn't know that throwing liquids/trash/spitting on people is a means of distraction for pickpocketers. awesome.. yay ignorance. while trying to clean myself up i become hazily aware of this woman and her two children standing uncomfortably close to me. i was on a busy street and i didn't think much of it, though my personal space was most definitely invaded. i didn't even notice my music stop playing. all of a sudden she's gone and a street vendor is yelling at me, bringing me down to earth telling me that i had just been robbed. then it all clicks.

of course that's what just happened!

my initial reaction was.. uh.. wait... what.. oh what the fuck!!! and i just kept thinking to myself: ""why the fuck didn't this vendor intervene while he saw everything happening!?!?"" i mean maybe the people were armed, there's many reasons. so he tells me that she got onto a bus that was (wow just my luck!) stopped at the red light a few yards away. as i confusedly approach, i realize that there are three buses, all completely stuffed. there's no way that i am finding her ever again. had my iphone jacked right out from under my nose. felt like a total idiot, also violated from the saliva shower. only solace is that the screen was completely fucked. oh well..",got spat on and robbed while stoned and studying abroad in a foreign country without even realizing until it was over.
79,"a wee bit of backstory: i don't drink hard liquor, i don't like it and it doesn't like me. i can drink wine and beer regularly with little to no issue but stay away from the hard stuff. amongst my friends and family there is a standing ban against two types of liquor specifically; vodka, because it makes me cry like a baby, and tequila, because i will (attempt) to have sex with pretty much anything. now i think whiskey will be added to that list.

the story: my wife and i are prepping up for a night of pizza, booze, tv at the liquor store and i reach for my old familiar 6 pack. she says that she is bored with beer and had heard one of her friends talking about how delicious rye whiskey and lemonade are, so i consent and grab a bottle.

we get home and start mixing drinks, and the mixture is quite delicious. it has the sweet tang of lemonade and the oaky warmth of whiskey but zero alcohol taste, this is a bad thing. the drunker i get the less i can taste the alcohol, so the stronger i make the drinks, so the drunker i get and it snowballs from there.

my next memory is waking up the next morning, still very drunk, and feeling like i've been trampled by a team of horses. my wife has already left for work an hour ago, so i get dressed rather sloppily and head out myself. i carpool and it was not my day to drive so i didn't drive drunk. i make it there and get settled in with a muffin to soak up the alcohol and text my wife to see why i am so sore. her reply, ""you bit me and i kicked the shit out of you."" i go to the bathroom and lock the door and take off my shirt to find my side and shoulder to be one giant bruise.

these are the events of the evening as pieced together from my wife's story. i drank most of the bottle of whiskey by myself.  she had two drinks with ~2 shots each, and i had the rest. i was not able to make it through the daily show and colbert report so my wife drug me to bed and tried to have sex with me. by this point i apparently had unprecedented levels of whiskey dick so that wasn't going to happen and i just yelled/sobbed drunkenly into my pillow for a while. she finds the quite amusing and starts jokingly saying things like about me being impotent (which i'm not normally) just so she can laugh at my over the top responses.

eventually i just get annoying and it late so she rolls over and tries to go to sleep, accidentally pulling the covers off of me. so, i do what any rational person would do and bite her. and not a nibble either, i lock on like a pitbull and don't let go, apparently i also pull her hair. my wife slugs me in the forehead until i let go, then a few more times in the side of the head and the shoulder/rib area for good measure before kicking me (literally) out of bed.

she isn't mad, in fact she finds it quite hilarious. but i have never felt worse (mentally or physically) and it doesn't help when she makes spousal abuse jokes.

 

edit : some words.","i'm a light weight, i fight like a girl, and my wife has a wicked left."
80,"i'd been planning to switch banks for some time now.  i have been stewing and stewing over the fact that my bank has started assessing a $6 monthly service fee if your account balance falls below $500 during any time during the previous month.

so they're charging me for being poor.  if i was wealthy and could maintain a high balance, the account would be free.  that just seems horribly wrong to me.

so today was payday.  i took my check to the bank and told them i wanted to keep out part of it in cash and deposit the rest into the account.  the lady said ""i'm sorry, since this check is drawn on a different bank, i'm going to have to deposit the whole thing and it will become available to you first thing tomorrow morning, but i can't give you any cash out of it today.""  i replied with ""okay, why do i even have an account with you then?  i'm just going to come inside and close out my account.""

i went inside, expressed my opinions about their monthly ""being poor"" fee and the fact that they wouldn't give me my money most verbosely, calling them ""useless"" and ""the most un-helpful and uncaring bank i've ever used.""

about an hour or so later, it hit me: on february first, i filed my federal income taxes, and scheduled my hefty return to be direct-deposited...into the bank account that i had just closed...

where is my pride?  i seem to have lost it.  i've had a bit of indigestion lately, i think maybe i swallowed it.  the last time i saw it was right before i called the bank, apologized, and begged them to reopen my account... which they were kind enough to do, preventing me from having to wait months and months while the irs kept my refund tied up in limbo.","got mad at my bank, closed my bank account, and then realized that my federal tax refund was scheduled to direct-deposit into that account.  had to call them and beg to get it reopened.  my pride is no more.  it has ceased to be."
81,"ok, so this happened a couple weeks ago in my research lab. this might be a little confusing if you aren't a scientist or chemist, but i'll try to make it readable for you non-scientists out there. btw, i am an undergraduate researcher, so you can imagine some of the stupidity that will ensue.

i work in a lab that tries to make crystals to see if a unique chemical structure is formed. one time i was using ethanol (alcohol) as a solvent for my reaction, and i knew that the product formed from the reaction would not crystallize with ethanol, so i had to vaporize the ethanol out of the solution by heating the solution beaker on a hot plate. once the ethanol was vaporized, i was left with the product in the hot/warm beaker. 

now this is an aside, for some reason or another the graduate tas and research educator prof i work with in the lab do not use the vent (hood) for many dangerous chemicals, like dichloromethane. maybe its because they find it inconvenient to work in the hood or maybe its because they work with dichloromethane so much they kinda forget about its dangers. so i thought since they don't use a hood when using dichloromethane, then maybe i don't need to, for the sake of ""efficiency"" (stupid mistake, very stupid). 

in case you don't know the dangers of dichloromethane: the first thing you have to know is that it is potentially carcinogenic. the second thing is that if you inhale/consume enough of it, then you can/will get carbon monoxide poisoning because dichloromethane is metabolized into carbon monoxide. carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to temporary blindness/blurriness. the third thing is that dichloromethane has a relatively low boiling point temperature (point at which the liquid turns into a gas that you can breathe).

now that the solid product is in my hot/warm beaker with no liquid ethanol, i am supposed to dissolve the product in dichloromethane, so that it will crystallize in a couple days. ok, so here's when things go outta hand. i start to add dichloromethane into the beaker, and i notice that the dichloromethane was vaporizing, like when you add water to hot skillet when you are washing it after you used it on the stove. i thought, no big deal, i do this all the time to cool down pots and stuff at home, no harm done? wrong! the next second, i took a normal breath of air. and my lungs sank like an anvil dropping to the bottom of an ocean. i realized what i had just done to myself. i, immediately, put the beaker into a vent (hood), and started breathing heavy to try and get as much dichloromethane out of my system as possible. i knew it was too late, but then i assured myself that i didn't breathe too much because i only put in like a couple mls of dichloromethane into the beaker. i left lab and went outside for like 30 minutes, and thankfully i didn't feel any strong effects due to the dichloromethane, except for blurriness in my eyes for a couple minutes (i think the blurriness may have come from the placebo effect of knowing the side effects of inhaling dichloromethane b/c i was thinking of that first).

i think i am lucky to be alive. reddit, tifu, and plan on not fucking up again in lab by being a shit ton more safe, rather than being ""efficient"".","i breathed a dangerous chemical because of stupid and unsafe lab techniques, and i should count myself lucky that nothing too dangerous occurred to my body because of it. now, i'm going to be the safest scientist ever."
82,"my fuck up actually started yesterday when i ate panda express for lunch and then mcdonalds for dinner.  i'm usually a really healthy eater so the introduction of this food into my system hasn't been treating me well today.  

so i was back in the bathroom to shit for the fourth time today and when i entered the bathroom i was talking on the phone and i forgot to lock the door.  i should mention the bathroom i was using was a male bathroom, it has a urinal and a stall with a toilet, but because of the flow of people it has been converted into a unisex bathroom that you are supposed to lock while in use. 

so i'm in there just blowing shit everywhere and talking on the phone.  i should also add that considering the door was locked i didn't shut the stall door and i sat with my pants and boxers all the way to the floor rather than up around my knees like people usually do in a stall, because no one was supposed to walk in.  

well the next thing i know i hear someone turn the handle, but to my surprise the next thing i know someone is walking in!  i scramble and shut the stall door and lock it as fast as i can and i hear them say something when they noticed someone was inside, but they promptly left.  i stand up and waddle over to the door and lock it and sit back down and continue on with my business.  the person i was on the phone with was obviously wondering what the fuck was going on and when i tell her what just happened she begins to laugh her ass off and she can't stop laughing and is laughing so hard we have to cut our phone conversation short. 

i spend a lot of time hoping whoever it was that walked in on me will be out of proximity of the bathroom by the time i leave.  so i attempt to sneak from the bathroom back to my office but i was spotted by the office secretary who noticeably turns and is obviously wondering who the fuck she walked in on in the bathroom shitting and yeah it was me and she knows it...fuck!

 

edit: typo",didn't lock the door and female secretary walks in on me with stall door open and pants around ankles while shitting
83,"let me start off my saying i know it's only forty bucks so its kinda whatever, but just listen. so i went to the dump for my mom, which is about three minutes down the road. i get there with my two bags of trash which costs a buck. i pay the guy and get these ticket things you throw down the chute with the garbage. i put the garbage down the chute and reach in my pocket and grab the stickers and throw em down with the bags. i drive home, let my dogs out, and then empty my pockets so i could take off my jacket and i find the two stickers still in my pocket. so i'm thinking to myself, ""i swear i just threw them down the chute..."" then it hit me and i reached in my pocket and of course my two nice crisp twenties were missing. so i flew back to the garbage man (going 65 in a 35 with a jeep cherokee mind you..) almost flipped my jeep on the way, and when i get there i explain the problem to the guy. what does he say? ""just ran the compressor about a minute ago, sorry bud, keep the two stickers for next time though."" all i could think was ""fuck.... fuck."" asked the guy if he knew what reddit was, he was old and of course said no but i told him i was putting it on here despite the fact he was probably thinking ""this kids a fuckin moron.."" then went home and went directly to my ipad to inform the reddit community how much of a dumbass i am!",threw fuckin 40 bucks down the garbage chute and got back a minute too late to have any hope of getting it back because my dumbass didn't realize it. one expensive trash day.
84,"so i decided to take the fiance for a nice meal at a nearby japanese restaurant. a short trip on the bus would do us nicely...or so i thought...the front seats are priority seats for old people so i led the other half to the back of the bus and sat down.

not long afterwards my leg started getting a little chilly, no worries i thought, there's just a breeze. after stepping off of the bus and touching the back of my leg i noticed it was wet. upon a gentlemanly sniff of the offending liquid.....i realized it was pee.","used a bus, made my fiance and i sit in someone else's pee."
85,"i work in a students union in an office upstairs. my friend works on the reception, right in the middle of the main entrance foyer downstairs. we both are big fans of the walking dead and are both pretty much up to the same point in the series, her always being a few episodes ahead. we love to discuss the show after i have caught up, so i was very excited as i made my way down the stairs one morning to talk about the episode i had watched the previous evening. i was so excited that when i came to the foyer, with my friend behind her desk facing me on the opposite side of the entrance hall, i couldn't help but start lumbering towards her, head cocked, arms writhing and outstretched, loudly snarling, moaning and groaning, doing the best zombie impression i could. i thought it would make my friend laugh, excite her for the upcoming zombie conversation, and also to try and distract her while she dealt with the lone customer who was stood with her back to me, talking to her. the hall was almost empty save the girl with her back to me. as i lurched ever nearer, i was confused as to why my friend was not smiling at my funny joke, but instead looking horrified and almost frozen with panic. it was too late before i realized why. only two paces from the girl with her back to me, i continued with my brilliant impression, idiotically ignoring my friends grimace and instead increasing the vigor of my performance as i drew nearer.


all at once, with horror, i realized what i was doing. i heard the girls voice as she noticed me and spun around. i could not break character fast enough. we locked eyes, my face contorted, arms akimbo, body bent. she had downs syndrome. she thought i was mocking her. the world stood still as my friend, paralyzed by the proximity of my shame and shock, stared at me, mouth agape. i had no words. i locked eyes with the stranger for what felt like eons before turning tail and fleeing outside.


fortunately, there were few people about; the entrance hall and reception area is usually packed, so only the three of us know my cringe-worthy shame.","people with downs syndrome are not likely to appreciate your zombie impression, no matter how good it is. **"
86,"so, to start off i am 13 years old and this all happened last sunday. i was messing around, not thinking, and was swirling a half dollar in between my teeth. as unlucky as i was, it slipped in between my teeth, went down my throat, tried to cough it up, made it even worse, and completely swallowed the damned thing without a problem. i still wonder how i did not choke on it. well i tell my parents that it was just a qauter to lessen tension on them and go along the week until friday hoping it would pass. my hopes were nothing but crushed as 5 days go by without passage. so on friday we go and get an xray and waddya know, its still stuck in my stomach. two days go on and were still hoping for the best. suddenly, my little brother gets a stomach virus and starts vomiting all over. bad news, since its still in my stomach by then, or as i thought, if i threw up it might come up and i could choke in it. of course as luck would have it i wake up only to start projectile vomiting all over the damn bathroom. the quarter didn't come out, luckily, but we still needed to go to the er to make sure i was safe. so today i spent a good 5 hours in the er, got two x rays done to find out it passed into my colon. but because it is so big, theres a chance it might not pass and i would have to get surgery, but, theres also the possibility that it could just rip right through my colon causing me the worst pain of my life and giving me a colin bag for my shit if i live on the outside of my body forever. of course, thats only a 1% chance, but its still there. just, wonderful. i am praying to god i shit this thing out and be done with this burden.  

heres an update: it has not passed and most likely going to get a tube up the ass and get it pulled out. pleasant. :<","[accidently swallowed a half dollar, went to the er, and could actually die if it rips through my colon.]"
87,"this actually happened a couple weeks ago, but i'll start with how things work. at the ups hub the loaders get packages that come down the belt from the sort aisle, then you load them into the semi trailer. that trailer might be going to florida, new york, or another state that your area covers. 

well, sometimes the people that slide the packages down your trailer's chute, slide down the wrong bags that are filled with packages. well, in the hurry i was in (being peak season and all) i accidentally forgot to check/scan one of the bags. aaaand it just happened to be bad. the worst one that could come down my belt. it was full of paychecks to the louisville hub. a hub of 5,000+ workers. and i loaded into a northern ohio trailer.","i caused an entire hub of 5,000+ people to not get their paychecks for a couple days."
88,"barely even 10 days ago, my mom got me a brand new samsung galazxy s4 for christmas. anyways, last night i went to my friends birthday party and after the party ended, my drunk self thought it would be a good idea to walk home. (the walk probably took around 2 hours but luckily it wasn't raining or too cold) midway through my little adventure home, i realized that i didn't have my phone. the problem here is that i don't remember if i had my phone when i left my friends house. i told my friend what happened and asked him to keep me updated if he finds it or not but i have yet to hear back from him. i'm really worried that it somehow fell out of my pocket when i was walking home. i tried using the android device manager to track my phone but i'm quite sure my phone was out of batteries by the time i tried tracking it down. best christmas ever :/",got drunk and lost my brand new s4 the day before christmas
89,"i'll admit this didn't just happen today. this was years ago, but i thought you all would enjoy it.

i was 18 years old and had just moved out of my apartment about a month prior. an acquaintance of mine moved into the same apartment 'block' as me a month before i moved out. this is important. 

she held a party one summer evening at her apartment and i attended with some friends. i should say, at the time i was known as a guy that likes to drink. tonight was no exception. bring on the whiskey.

cue blackout. 
you know when you wake up from a night of heavy drinking and your memories are just flashes of pictures. you string them along creating a hazy timeline.

picture:
me stumbling down the stairs

""i'm hungry...""

picture:
me standing at the drive through window

""you need a car to use the drive through. we can't serve you.""

when i wake up after drinking way too much alcohol my consciousness comes in stages. first i became aware of my body. i'm uncomfortable and cold, why do i not have a blanket? what the fuck am i laying on?

a 35lbs weight. 

i open my eyes and see i'm sleeping on the ground and in what appears to be a weight room; i was sleeping next to the bench press. things start churching in my disoriented, hungover mind as i started recognizing my surroundings, and i begin to panic. i was in my old bedroom! 

how the fuck did this happen!?!? i tried thinking of ways out of this. i put my head to the door and could hear voices. a male and a female. can i climb out the window? no, that's a long fall. there was only one way out of this and i knew what i had to do. 

with my ear against the door i lightly knocked. i heard a gasp and a murmur. there was no turning back now. i opened the door and came out with my hands up. the new apartment owners were an asian couple in their mid 20s and the they were not very happy to see me.

i immediately tried to explain that i used to live here, i don't know how this happened, please don't call the cops or kick my ass. i told him i still had a key to the apartment as i was never told to turn it in and never bothered to take it off my keyring. i figured the locks would get changed. i gave him the key and he told me to empty my pockets to show i didn't steal anything. we were at a standstill, and he was seriously considering calling the cops.

and do you blame him!? imagine that! cooking breakfast with your significant other on a sunday morning when some haggard looking stranger comes wallowing out of your weight room! how do you react to that?

he eventually let me go. he told me to never come back to that apartment complex. i agreed and left. i ran faster than i've ever ran. i must have ran a good mile before i stopped and called my friend to pick me up.

apparently i told them i was going to get some food and never came back to the party. turned my cellphone off and said fuck it.",blacked out. trespassed.
90,"so today was pretty horrible for me. also, throwaway because some people i know at school browse reddit and this subreddit quite frequently. and the last thing i need is someone to find out all of my dirty secrets

today was one of the last days of school (last official day for seniors is friday) and we had gotten our yearbooks last friday. everyone has been signing each other's yearbooks and i was happy when i got to my first period because it means that i get to see my crush.

a little background is in order. i'm a girl and so is the girl i like. i am bisexual and i haven't come out of the closet yet and i'm not quite ready to. i plan on doing it soon, but it's not just something i want to do overnight. anyway, i've liked her for about three years and we are going to different colleges. we have first period together and i would say we're friendly acquaintances but not quite friends.

earlier in the year i got this bright idea to write a ridiculous love poem that i would put in her locker. i don't know why the hell i decided to do it, but i decided to do it. the poem is okay. it's not too cringy but it's not that bad. it is basically proclaiming my love for her from an anonymous person and saying that i will always have a place in my heart for her.

so this weekend i printed out the letter and i decided to seal it up nicely and put it in her locker. i left my 0 period class to go put it in her locker so that no one would see me. all went according to plan and i thought i was in the clear. then i went to first period.

so in first period we're passing around yearbooks. i had this whole note planned out where i told her how much she impacted my life and etc. it was just supposed to be in a friendly way with no romantic overtones. then i got distracted and got up for a second. when i came back, i forgot what i was writing. i finished the note and when i went to sign my name, i put a heart next to it with my name which was typical. then i put ""i love you"".

i didn't realize my mistake until i was handing it back to her. luckily she doesn't read them until after we're done at school, but i'm freaking out about the consequences of this. i'm sure someone will notice and say something.

also, i'm not the kind of girl who says ""i love you"" randomly to other girls. it seems out of place when i do it and almost everyone knows. so there isn't any writing this off as an accident.","put a love poem in the girl that i have liked for a while's locker. then accidentally signed ""i love you"" in her yearbook."
91,"let me preface this with the acknowledgement that no, i am not a genius, but i *am* a reasonably smart guy. unfortunately, i am nontheless a *guy*, which also means when i'm horny, i'm motherfuckin *horny*. 

i recently got a pretty gorgeous girlfriend who is also into harry potter and is generally pretty fantastic. it was a really insane story for another thread, but basically, she is/was the ""it girl"" on campus and has been around. one night, after watching night at the mueseum 2 (solid motion picture btw), we were swapping weird sex stories. she was kicking my ass, of course, as she had known more guys than i had girls. she mentioned one guy who was really into ass play. apparently, he had had the most intense orgasm she's ever seen. couple minutes later, we bang, something something basilisk in her chamber of secrets. sex is fun.

well, a couple days later i got curious. i decided that i needed to try ass play. don't ask me the reasoning; i had it in my head (and later i would have it in my butt) that this was the only way to go for now. i looked around for something to use, but weirdly didn't have much to work with. finally, i found an empty [blackberry izze bottle] (http://i.imgur.com/icpyhjc.jpg) that looked okay. i think even then i knew it wasn't my best idea, but i was also determined that *this empty beverage was gonna go in my butt, god damnit*.

it started off well. i had watched a little porn to understand what to do. you may not realize it, but the male prostate is only a couple inches past the anus; i didn't have to go deep. nonetheless, i was enjoying it moderately and pushed my limits. i don't think it would have been my greatest orgasm, but then i never found out, so maybe i should reserve judgment. anyway, i challenged myself to go deeper and deeper. by butthole was not used to this, and in a way it was like a competition with myself to prove that if i wanted to, i could get some surgery and star in backdoor sluts 12. it was enjoyable, if stressful. then it got bad.

i was doing this in my bedroom, ass in the air. little did i notice how i had inched toward my low, wooden nightstand. i became a tad bored, i suppose, and with 1/2 the bottle from the opening up my ass and unaware of my future despair, i made the biggest mistake of my life: i jerked my ass up, slamming the bottle into the nightstand and **shattering the bottle inside my asshole.**

**what the fuck. jesus. awww lord reekis someone help the fuck my butthole my butthole jesus fucking christ!** the pain was the greatest i have felt in my life; the panic of the shattering, i believe, had caused my anus to close as tight as possible, trapping the broken glass inside. furthermore, as i immediately slammed by ass to the ground, the glass inside further shattered. imagine *pieces of broken fucking glass, too big for your rectum, desperately poking and clawing from the inside to escape, as your poor ass bleeds from the wounds inside*. worse yet, simply *farting* caused the glass to sink deeper into my rectum. yes, the slighest bowel gas or movement increased my pain ten-fold. i called the hospital and got an ambulence sent; they rushed me there (on a bumpy highway, mind you) and three hours later i was in surgery. i'm in a hospital bed now, and i can't look any of the nurses in the eye. most of them giggle when they go over any treatments because they know what happened. my girlfriend literally cannot look at me without cracking up. she has taken to calling me glass-ass, or the broken butthole.",", i tried putting a bottle in my ass and it shattered, plunging me ino an infinity of pain and permanently bruising my manhood. also, my rectum.**"
92,"left the bar and stopped at my gf's house. her little sister was asleep, parents at work, little brother out. she was supposed to pick him at at 11, and it was only 10:20pm. so out of no where she starts fooling around with me, turns to a bj, but i'm buzzed so i tell her i cant finish and she tells me just to fuck her. i do, right there on the couch. but since her sister was in the house too (and me being a drunk genius) decide to leave our clothe on to be safe. i pull her shorts and panties halfway down her legs, my cock was already out, but pants still on. we bang it out, her legs over my shoulders and i finished after about 5 minutes (intended quicky). i go to the bathroom and she heads to her bedroom. i come out, see her on her bed, and bone her again. but being drunk and just cumming less than 2 minutes before, i lost my hard on after about 5 minutes. we pack up and head back to living room, and she has a text from her brother ""you are dirty ;)"". yes a winky face! turns out he walked home early, saw us through the front door, dont know what happened next, but he waited until we went into her room to sneak downstairs to his room. she went down to talk to him and she asked him what he saw he said ""you on the couch"". i wouldnt be surprised if he stood there watching.","** drunkenly boned girlfriend on her couch and her brother saw us, sent her a creepy text"

me: that coin you have specifically? is it in a case of some kind?    

r: no!    

me: well i do apologize sir. we can't guarantee that coin specifically is worth that amount unless it's been professionally graded and cased. we can certainly try to get as close to that value as possible but i would need to look at it first.    

r:....where are you located.

this is where i throw my punch in...metaphorically speaking...    

me: we're in the same location you were just at.    

r: which is!? you know what....how do you stay in business with your smart mouth?

94,"i was a freshman in high school. i was in my last period class, biology. of course, my add kicked in and it was extremely hard for me to concentrate on what the teacher was talking about.
so i pull out a small spiral, with like 200 pages in it.
earlier that week, i had started a sort of insider with my friends to make a new type of meme called ""sometimes i"" jokes. these jokes always began by saying ""sometimes i"" and never made any sense whatsoever. especially not to someone who wasn't in on the joke.
if i remember correctly, here was one of the jokes:
""sometimes i pretend i'm john lennon and fondle mojo jojo's tits.""
like i said, these jokes had absolutely no point to them. at all.
there i was, writing in that notebook, when my biology teacher realized i wasn't paying attention. she walked over to my desk, took my spiral, and continued teaching. in my mind i was panicking. i was so scared. after class, she called me up to her desk, and the worst thing imaginable happens... she opens the spiral. 
with my terrible luck, she of course happened to flip to the worst joke in the whole book:
""sometimes i rip my balls off with a chainsaw and then staple them back together.""
what the fuck was i thinking when i wrote those? i was immediately sent to the principal, my parents were called, and every joke was read to them. every. single. one.","i wrote hundreds of dumb jokes in a notebook and my parents, teacher, and principal think i'm mentally unstable."

it's an incredibly windy day in the city that i reside in. i'm driving through an industrial area where there is quite a bit of crime, and therefore are virtually no public restrooms as they most likely would be frequented by rapists and junkies. i had drank heavily the evening before this, and had worked out during the morning, so i'm filled with water to rehydrate me from both activities. it hits me like a brick wall - i must pee, or i'm going to pee my pants. i pull into a gas station parking lot, run inside, and am told that they aren't allowed to let customers into the bathroom for safety reasons - fuck. out of desperation, i walk next to the building and have an internal debate: do i urinate in this parking lot? no, too many people and not an offense i need. i run back to my vehicle, and begin driving down the road praying for a restroom

...and that's when i spot it. 

i haven't driven one block when i see the abandoned gas station with a lone porta-potty in the vacant dirt lot right next to it. i wouldn't normally use such a horrible facility, but it was either this or the seat of my car. i pull right up to the porta-potty, jump out and (leaving my car running) bust inside. as i'm taking an insanely high-pressure piss (this stream was truly powerful), i feel it...that...feeling in the rear. 

i try to hold the rear-end's contents in, but the sheer force from my bladder is causing everything in that entire region to let loose. i had my options: i can either, as a grown man, poop my pants, or pee on the porta-potty wall. i figured i had peed on less appropriate things at this age, and swung around while jerking my pants down to my ankles. 

as i begin, as my friend once put it, ""chocolate shotgunning"" into the general area of the toilet, while still pissing all over in front of/on me, the wind, which has begun to pick up drastically, rips the porta-john door completely open. it is then that i first see another vehicle pulling into the parking lot.

as the truck pulls in, i frantically finish my business. a man exits the vehicle, begins to walk up, and i hurry to pull my pants up over my poop-covered butt and semi-soaked front. 

i exit my box of shame that is the porta-potty, and quickly close the door to it. as i turn and begin waddling toward my vehicle, he stops to talk to me for a few seconds about how windy it is. after nodding my head and smiling, i speed-walk to my vehicle as he opens the door to my mess. 

i couldn't bring myself to look in that direction, and sped out of the parking lot as fast as i could.","pooped and peed all over a porta-potty while the door was ripped open by the wind. additionally, a kind old man was then exposed to my shameful doing."
96,"average day at work, not too busy, not too slow either, i just recently quit drinking so i'm not completely focused today not that my job really requires my 100% focus 100% of the time anyways so i'm getting by just fine. i'm getting ready to go on my break while waiting for another co worker to come in at 5, he's usually late so i decided to just go before he gets there, figure what's a few minutes anyways. so i head up stairs to get my headphones so i can drown out whoever's outside, i walk out of the department and quickly glance behind me to if he's there. bam. i hear a crack, fuck my first reaction was i knocked something over and it smashed on the ground. nope, i turn around to see this little girl her head laying on the floor and beginning to cry her fucking eyes out. her mom runs over and picks her up with my apologizing relentlessly, even after i come back down the stairs with my stuff. still feel fucking horrible about this, she seemed to be ok just upset like any kid would be but still can't stop thinking about it and how that little girls doing now.","turn around for a split second, little girl goes down."
97,"so my day pretty much sucked.
let's start off with the shitty morning of me waking up early at 7:30. so i just sit on my couch and recollect my thoughts of my daily chores. half asleep, my mother comes upstairs saying we need to help my 90-year-old grandmother.

**shit just hit the fan**

so we scarf down a leftover pancake and head out to the car. we drive 2 blocks down the street to my grandmothers crappy old house. we push her out in her rickety old wheelchair to the 90 degree car, as she bitches and moans about how she doesn't wand to go outside and ""she wants to stay home and catch up on her shows."" now mind you when shes home she constantly complains about being lonely.

she does have a caretaker who does not speak fluent english, so when you combine that with a defective-hearing old lady, you get a serious tornado of confusion. we drive to the mall and walk around macy's and all the terrible woman stores that my mother drags me to.

but, after about 3-4 hours, we decide it's insanely hot and why not get some ice-cream? ohhh ho ho hooo! that was the moment of truth! we drove to wendy's and ordered four chocolate frosty shake things. we drive around the neighborhood so everyone can indulge on the fine delicacy that is chocolate. but this was no delicacy....this was satan's very shit in my cup. after about 2/3 of my ice cream demolished by my sweet tooth... i felt a shit coming on.

so i asked my mom to politely pull in front of my house so i may rush to the bathroom. i sit down as a stream of brown liquid floods the porcelain throne in which i sit. oh god the full blown squirts. 4 times in the past 2 hours have i shit the milky ooze. my toilet is clogged and i still have to shit. at this point my anus has the grand canyon tearing through my buttcheeks.

i take a shower to cleanse by bungholio of its pain. i apply some cream to stop the burn. that was a **mistake**! i've never felt such pain in my ass it cannot be put into words. and it still burns now. an hour later.","i ate a wendy's frosty, got the shits, burned and tore my butthole into a gateway to oblivion, and clogged my only toilet"
98,"yesterday evening my mother and i were walking through the mall. i turned my head to the left and saw a beautiful casual dress in the window of hot topic: black with a pink ""galaxy"" pattern and white stars. it looked like someone had put pictures from a telescope on it. 

seeing that the dress was only twenty five dollars, my mom agreed to buy it for me as a reward for my good grades if they had it in my size. i went inside, and a very nice but pushy saleslady showed me to the dressing room in the back to try it on. 

there was a rather short velvet curtain covering the entrance. it was knee-height on me and had to be hooked to the side of the wall. i stood in the middle of the dressing room so i couldn't be seen through the small gap between the curtain and the wall, and to read an article about death cab for cutie that was pasted to the low ceiling. 

at that moment, i decided i wanted to see how the dress would look with the high-tops i was wearing at the moment. after struggling to get my jeans off over my giant feet, i realized the shoes looked stupid and tried to take them off. this was where the fuckup came.

for some odd reason, i didn't sit down on the nearby bench or lean on a wall. i stood in the middle of the closet-sized room on one leg and began trying to pull off my right shoe. however, the shoelaces are too small and even with the bow undone i couldn't get it off. instead of merely sitting down, i continued to pull at the shoe, balancing there.

a fireball of pain exploded in my left thigh, the leg i was balancing on. in my quest to remove my shoe, i had been putting a lot of strain on my left thigh muscle, which now gave out. the sudden pain made me lose my balance and i pitched forward, falling through the velvet curtain and onto the floor of the hot topic. 

the dress took this opportunity and fly up, exposing my underwear and the back of my bra. the pushy saleslady grabbed a clothes rack on wheels and rolled it forward to shield me from the rest of the store, but i know a few people saw me. five minutes later i staggered out, limping, and we bought the dress.","didn't sit down while taking off my shoes, got a cramp, exposed myself to a store full of special snowflakes.**"
99,"*using a throwaway because well, who knows who reads this site. anyway, i never thought i would be worthy of a post here. not because i think i'm perfect, but because my fuck ups usually are not that notable. i was wrong.*

let me set the scene for you: my wife and i just moved in with some family. now by family, i mean grandmas house, her parents live here too, her sister and sisters husband, and their two kids. not a huge house. very christian household. anyway, we are currently stationed in a family room because all the bedrooms are occupied. we have a door to the outside that just so happens to be on the same outer wall as a door into a laundry room and office where the main door is left open and only the screen is in place. now this sounds like no big deal, but to get into the house we have to go outside and back in through that office door. (we have the official doorway inside blocked) so i, as male, love peeing outside. 

around 3am i wake up, feel the urge, and meander on out the door. at night, i don't make it in the other door. why? nobody is awake. pee outside! ahhhhhhhhhh, sweet release. well, also as male, i had a little chub going on down there. i figured ""what the hell, i am going to fap one out right here. then i will go right back to sleep all comfy"" proceed to a few minutes of outdoor, cool breeze fapping. it was glorious. truly unlike any fap sesh in at least a year. i hear someone! peek...look normal (dick in hand), nobody. whew, scary. well, it is three am. why would anyone be in this secluded area of the house? 

proceed, and finish on lawn. another sweet release. much better this time. and then the inner door behind me shuts with such ferocity it is as if dwayne johnson was the mysterious being on the other side of that opaque window. what had they seen? who was it? my mind races. i stand there for another couple minutes, then go back in. no sounds outside our room. i wake up this morning, nobody has said anything to my wife or i. i now live in a constant state of fear; fear of when or if i get asked what happened last night on the patio...

***reddit, today i fucked up.***",i may have incidentally met dwayne johnson.
100,"warning, wall of text.

i work at a mcdiabeetus. and we sell sweet tea, any size for a dollar, this being 'murica, it sells like crazy (especially the large sized), especially after april. 

the tank in the lobby ran out of sweet tea so i was tasked with putting sweet tea in said tank. i do the routine, take the tank behind the counter and set it down. then i'm supposed to take a bucket and put the sweet tea in that bucket into said tank. this is where it went to hell. the bucket slipped out of my hand and sweet tea and ice went everywhere. 

after the shock of what happened, i took to cleaning it up (an hour os my life i will never get back. i'm cleaning and laughing/crying over my idiocy, while everyone just laughs. i then have to move a cart out of the way to clean under there too (it will become relevant shortly). i begin deck scrubbing that area and then go to get more water. suddenly the water won't come and i was stuck using nasty water. the back sink also stopped working and the toilets wouldn't flush and anything using water just shutdown (including the soda machines). we couldn't sell soda, wash dishes and the bathrooms were put out of order too. we were worried it was something majorly serious.

the store manager was called and the police department was called. they dispatched the water department and the problem was found quickly. turns out someone had shutoff the main water valve, shutting off water to everything. he showed how it could have been done, and i was the only culprit. the hispanics in the kitchen all said ""genius, you no bueno."" i was dubbed the walking disaster","i dropped a bucket of sweet tea and when cleaning it up, moved something turning off the water valve, shutting down water to the whole store."
101,"so to start off, i am a medical cannabis patient. and because i cannot smoke by my house because my grandparents would kill me, i find time to smoke a half a mile from my house. so here i am driving along smoking a blunt, enjoying myself after a long day at work, when i decide i am finished. so i start rolling the cherry out my window. little did i know it was hella windy and being in a moving car didn't help. so instead of my cherry blowing out the window, it blew right back in my face, my eye to be exact. still moving, i start swatting my face, and than i realized the cherry flew into my passenger side foot well and hit some paper that i had down there, and what do you know, it caught fire. so i pulled over and spent 5 minutes stomping out a small fire in my car. 

 

edit: i'm a girl. i was getting tired of being referred to as *he*","smoked a blunt while driving home, tried to put it out, started a small fire in my car. i am a dumb ass."
102,"more like ""two years ago i fucked up"", in this case.

my high school was putting on a musical and i was on the crew because i wanted to participate, but don't like to sing in front of people. my job was to open and close the curtains at the appropriate times. easy enough, and i became close friends with all the cast members. for the entire play, i sat at a small chair just behind the fully closed curtain. behind me was the backstage room with the costume rack, sinks and mirrors, and some old lockers.

it was opening night. the show was starting in twenty minutes and the school gym was already full of people. no one was supposed to go out from behind the curtain at this point. i don't know if it was nerves or what, but my stomach started rumbling and i had to shit. i had to shit so, so badly. 

i managed to hold it in for fifteen more minutes, but when everyone was preoccupied with mic checks and lighting checks and makeup, i was sitting uncomfortably in my chair, feeling like i was going to explode. i couldn't even sit properly, instead having to sit with my ass about an inch off the seat.

i knew i had to go before it was time to open the curtain for the beginning of the show. the only person not occupied was the male lead. i managed to stammer out (intimidated because he was a senior) ""is there a bathroom anywhere back here?"" wordlessly, he pointed to what i had thought was a supply closet.

it *was* the size of a supply closet, and i felt like i was getting stared down by the filthy toilet brush in the corner, but it was a toilet. i released fury from my bowels and felt sweet, sweet relief. then i got up, wiped and flushed. i sat triumphantly back in my chair and opened the curtain. 

after the first two or three songs, the director of the play, a teacher, came up to me and took me into the backstage room to go through some materials i would pass out at intermission and extra microphone tape. he saw me glancing at the bathroom and said, ""don't use that toilet, it doesn't flush right."" 

puzzled, i said, ""yeah, someone told me that"" because i was suddenly overcome with shame and didn't want him to know i'd used the filthy corner toilet. the play went flawlessly until intermission. i was sitting, back against the wall, with some other girls when the director stormed out.

""who the hell used the toilet?"" he said. i'd never seen him so angry. everyone started sniggering as he repeated, ""who did it? i told you all it's broken!"" 

like a wave almost, everyone got up and ran for the bathroom. i heard laughter and then someone shrieked...there was a single turd, floating in a puddle of brown shit water in the middle of the toilet. i stood there shamefully, staring at it. as i left the bathroom, i caught the male lead's eye and had no words for the expression on his face.",i managed to screw up by not shitting myself.**
103,"oh. my. god. this is fucking awful.  

so brief background: i've been on adderall for a while, right? well the loveliest of side effects is that it makes your shit set up camp and just chill in your intestines. 

technically you could say ""yesterday i fucked up"", but it is today that i am reaping the repercussions of my actions. so basically i hadn't pooped in almost a week. bad news bears, i thought. so around 2pm i decided to take a single extra-strength laxative to kick down the doors and do some spring cleaning. no biggie. i do this sometimes. it usually results in a leisurely 30 minute session of poop just easily coming out of me like frozen yogurt. 

naturally, later, i got hungry for dinner. being the laziest fucking hambeast there is, i reached for something quick, disregarding my decision earlier. what i grabbed was my industrial size box of fiber one bars, you know the kind you can get at bulk stores and could probably sustain a third world country for a day. 

so i sat myself down at my desk and resumed doing some college shit. i had my delicious fiber one bars, of which i thought would be a good thing if i brought the entire box with me, and my glass of chocolate milk. now i'm lactose intolerant, but it's usually ok if i just drink a glass and be careful about what i eat the rest of the day. being the dumb fuck that i am and not connecting all of these things, i lost track of all time and things and before i knew it i had downed 10 of those fuckers and my full glass of milk. ain't no thang, right? wrong. 

by 10 pm the gurgles started. i just thought nothing of it and continued working. then the farts came like the fucking valkyrie. at first it was just one whisper-thin fart every 15 minutes or so. soon, it escalated to some sort of anal rapture. my asshole was playing the 1812 overture in f minor. i swear to god  i think i ripped my sphincter.

i went to bed around 5am and actually managed to fall asleep. at roughly 6 am i was jostled awake by a fierce noise that i couldn't pinpoint the origin of. then it happened. the farts had gotten worse and now sounded like chewbacca deepthroating a burrito. it was terrible. my entire abdomen was cramping. then the smell. it crawled through the air, something like a unique septic odor, like shit mixed with dead and decaying animals. 

this lasted for a few more hours. every two minutes i'd cramp up, then release the tension in the form of severe anal rot. 10:30 comes around and around that time i was going to take another rip when i realized there was something sinister behind it. i am not athletic, but i may as well been  bred with kenyans because i fucking usain bolted it to the toilet. 

taking my place, the next thing i heard was a slight noise piercing the air, somewhat of a high pitched squeak, then immediately followed by the most low and rumbling thunderous sound. then the shit of a lifetime. the kind of shit that makes people stop believing in god. it was like i gave birth via my rectum.

so now it's almost noon and i'm sitting on the toilet typing this on my phone between anal hiccups from hell, since between that first gastric giant breaking the seal and now, it's been like my asshole is just puking water. i'm hunched over from the pressure of gas on my insides. it feels like that thing from alien is trying to claw its way out of my stomach and its screams are escaping by means of fart.  i am a dumb bitch.

104,"about a year ago i was a part of the stage construction/ stage crew for my schools fall play. during the play the people in stage crew could stay there or go home. i was gonna go home, but then the director said i would need to fill in for some missing actors. right here is where it fucks up. i have a female friend i have always kinda had a crush on, well i was sitting against a wall talking to some of the other guys in stage crew. well she comes over and lays her head on my thigh, which i kinda got aroused from her doing that, and then her cue came up for her to get on stage. so she left, she came back about 5 minutes later and laid her head on my thigh again. she unzipped her sweatshirt a little bit and i could see her cleavage slightly, which got me even more aroused. she left again and came back, and did the same thing. this time she was fixing her hair and she set her hair tie on my leg, when she needed her hair tie again she started feeling around for it, her hand went up, and up, and up, then she touched my dick. and i came. as soon as she touched it. she knew she touched my dick, but i don't think she knew i got off from it. i left as soon as i could after that.","i had a crush on a girl, she touched my dick through my jeans on accident and i ejaculated."
105,"tifu while playing league of legends when one of a friend (whom i happen to have a huge crush on)'s friends started saying that he liked her. i flipped my shit, caused a scene, and more than likely lost a good friend because of it. so far, she's blocked me on skype and facebook and unfriended me on lol.

 

**update:** she unblocked me, we're talking now. apparently the other guy in this story freaked her out, and now i'm somehow the good guy in this.",flipped a shit when i found out likes the same girl i do. pissed her off and won't see her again for a bit.
106,"so i went to see my grandparents with my mom at a resort-like retirement villa. it was a wonderful place with lots of beautiful scenery and activities for the seniors to do with visiting relatives.

we ordered our food at the restaurant there and started catching up on things. while dining on some not-so-well cooked shrimp scampi, my grandfather (who is developing alzheimer's) asks a question.

""bet you've never seen so many old people in one place""

instead of just saying ""no"", my brain immediately responds with something you don't say around seniors. especially at the volume i decided to use.

""well, i live near a cemetery and old people are pretty common there""

followed by a long, awkward silence from all 4 of us. my 80-something year old grandparents acting like nothing happened, my mom staring at me, disgusted, and me just staring stupidly at the way my napkin matches the tablecloth.",i mentioned a cemetery around my grandparents instead of just shutting my mouth like i should've.
107,"i ran track in high school and run with friends as a recreational activity. i'll get right to the point. there's this cemetery that my friends both love and loathe. it's not your ordinary cemetery; it's huge and hilly with various ponds and such scattered. it's a very tiring route to run through, and i have only seen other people there once. my running group consists of the short term runners, who are really far behind every run, and the long term runners, who are always in the front. i'm about in the middle, so during this run i end up by myself for a bit. the cheap exerciser i am, i decide to run off the path and cut through the cemetery to save time and effort. i'm running through thick grass where the tombstones are when suddenly, i drop around 5 feet; i had just fallen in what i believe to be an open grave. it was pretty big and my ankles were decimated by the landing. my initial reaction was i had just fallen on a corpse, but i knew that was not the case. i lifted myself out of the grave and limped for a bit until my friends in back caught up and i told them what happened. i eventually was able to run the 4 miles back with the adrenaline, but when it settled, my legs killed.",decided to take a shortcut during my jog in a cemetery and fell in an open grave.
108,"i just want to vent. i don't care if anybody reads this, and i haven't told anybody because i don't want to burden them with my emotional bs. i don't care if she ever sees this. she'll know it's her, but it won't matter; she still won't talk to me. neither will any of her friends. they think i'm scum. which is a pretty accurate description. my ego seems to be my most damning enemy.

i met her in the navy; we were on the same ship, in the same division. she is gorgeous, fun, smart, level-headed, a real rare breed, which explains why she always had a boyfriend. we were friends, and she was flirty with me, but i just told myself that was her personality. i wanted to date her, but i never knew until too late that she had broken up with her previous boyfriend. this went on for roughly 5 1/2 years.

she got out of the military and moved 3 hours away, but our friendship grew closer. i started making excuses just to see her. we were really flirty with each other, so i kissed her. it was amazing! the best thing i had done to date! i was a 26 year old who never had a serious girlfriend, but i got girls on a frequent basis, but this kiss topped everything! we spent the night together, and i asked her to date me, but she said she couldn't, that she was still getting over her previous boyfriend of two years, but i persisted over the next couple of months, and she finally agreed. so begins the first of my f ups, in a long, drawn out series of them. i should have let her heal and recuperate, but that's not what i wanted. i told myself that i could make it better. my ego so sayeth.

we went on our first date the day after i got out of the navy, and she loved it! she said it was still the best date she'd ever been on the last time i talked to her, and it showed. she was glowing and beaming! a non-stop smile the entire evening! and that's how she made it the best date i've ever been on: to this day i can't remember if she walked at all that night. i only have recollections of her floating, which isn't the first time this has happened. the first time i saw her after my last deployment, she floated into the room with a flowing white summer dress and red lipstick. in my mind, she's always floating, while smiling and laughing. and the times when i woke up next to her, with the sunlight casting a halo around her, she would wake up and comment about her hair being whacky, but i never saw anything more beautiful than in those moments. she would then get ready for school or work and come downstairs, which turned out to be my daily fashion show, were it played out like the scene in every teenage prom movie, and in my mind she slowly walked down the stairs and lit up my whole world. these were the best days of my life, but i mistakenly never told her.

after that, it was a steady downhill slide. i got out of the navy early with two weeks notice, which didn't give me any time to look for a job.  i was collecting unemployment, but it was barely enough to cover the mortgage on my un-rented house, let alone all of the other bills i had. i was living off of my credit card, and worried that i was going to lose my house. i went back and forth from my place, trying to get it ready to rent out, to her, trying to keep this fledgling relationship afloat, and my parents' place, 4 hours away from her, 7 from my house, trying to mooch off of them to save money. on top of all of this, i was steadily getting rejected after job interviews, sliding me further and further into a funk. i was depressed, my ego didn't think it was possible for these jobs to not want me. and this girl made me want to be the best i could be, so that i could be the best for her, but my unemployment status was preventing this. i knew i could be better for her, but while lamenting, i was not a good boyfriend.

after all of this, she thought it was best that we break up. i agreed, being that it wasn't a great time for either of us, and we mutually parted as friends. we kept in contact for a couple of months, until i took her out for her birthday, when the majority of my monumental f ups take place.

we went to an '80's dance party with a bunch of her friends, where she was showing me the classic signs of attraction: touching, paying specific attention to me, but i thought nothing of it. the last sure thing she said relationship related to me was that she thought i was great, but that she was happy being alone. she made it clear and obvious that night that she was attracted to me, but i was too thick-headed to get it. we spent that next couple of weeks hanging out, and she would show me all of the obvious signs, but i would either brush them off or not realize it until later, sometimes right after we parted.

this is where my ego takes control and ruins it: i convince myself that i'm just confused by her, and that if she wants me to ask her out, she has to say something. make no mistake, this is solely my ego and arrogance licking its' wounds and demanding to be soothed, pacified and satiated. i recognized the signs, but ignored them, for this stupid reason.

she then moved into a new apartment, and invites me to her housewarming party. while there, she showers me with attention, ignores other guys and often shrugs them off for me, but this isn't good enough for me and my ego. oh, no, we want retribution! i even literally pushed her away from me at one point, but this sweet thing shrugs that off and comes right back to me. it seems to me like everything is finally falling into place, but it never does. she never gives my ego the satisfaction it craves, and i sleep alone that night.

the next couple of months go by, and our interactions slowly decrease. i'm sure she's hurt by the constant rejection i'm dishing out, as a girl of this caliber should never be. however, my ego's cravings for satisfaction seem to become almost manic. she's not appeasing it, so i look for other outlets, mostly girls picked up at a bar somewhere. this gives me a false sense of entitlement, almost, or that i could get any girl i wanted, and that it was just a matter of time before she gave me what i wanted.

she then invites me to her friends' birthday party, an '80's prom themed dance party. i was named prom king. i only mention this because at first it seemed trivial, but i now realize that it just furthered my opinion of myself, and that i was going to get what i wanted, but nothing was further from the truth. at this party, she is ignoring me, and is all over someone else. i couldn't comprehend this. i was distraught, to say the least. other girls at the party showed interest in me, but to me there was only one, and she couldn't care less for me.

after a night of drinking, she goes to her room to pass out. i still care deeply for her, being that she's the first girl i ever had, so i went to find out if she was ok. i woke her up, asked her is she wanted some water, at which point her new guy is there, and he gives it to her. her room mate shows up, then she passes out and we leave. we wake up the next morning, and i go to sit by her bed, but she again passes out and i leave. at the time, neither of these incidents seemed to be a big deal, but they would come back to haunt me a week later.
i go up to my parents' for a week, and the whole time i'm wondering what had happened, when it dawned on me that it was my ego that was driving me to hurt this beautiful lilly of a girl, and that i should just suck it up and ask her out, despite the most recent events. i was even talking and joking with her for a week, and we made plans to hang out when i returned.

when i got into town, she wouldn't return my texts or answer my calls. i didn't consider this a big deal, and tried calling and texting her over the next couple of days, all met with the same response. i didn't hear from her until she sent me a text saying that some one had told her i was watching her sleep at the party and that we couldn't hang out anymore! and that's the last time i heard from her.

at first i was upset that i lost my chance with her, but then i realized that even though she is a rare breed, if she's one in a million, there are 35 of them in california, and that if i could attract a girl like that once, i could most certainly do it again. the one time my ego is helpful, and possibly right. but i was still hurt that she wouldn't allow me a confrontation, an explanation or defense. i wasn't angry, i just wanted to know what was going on, and i didn't want to start a fight, nor cause a rift between any friends. i just wanted to know if it was true, being that i was drinking, the mere mention of it makes it a possibility, and how convicted her and her friends have been. it didn't take me long to realize that this was again my ego, wanting to know why she accused me and believed that i could do something like that! but some simple objective reasoning answered that: she had to. i forced her hand and made her. why would she choose me, the egotistical, arrogant asshole who toyed with her emotions for months, over anybody that could have said that? she couldn't.
it's my idea that there is no such thing as truth; that truth is just bent to the will of popular opinion. her truth, what she chooses to believe, because it is a choice, is that i did that, and that i'm a creepy douche. and that is all that matters.

i don't believe that it happened, but that's what i choose to believe, which might be controlled by my ego again. however, i am so glad to have met a person like that in my life, and that she introduced me to the wonders of the opposite sex, and the wonders that a relationship can do for me. and i'm so glad for each new day, which is a second chance to live better than you did the previous.

1st edit: i apologize for the lack of spacing, it was there in the draft, and this is my first post of this nature. as for the lack of tl;dr, as i said, i don't care if anybody reads this, i'm just venting. i've never told anybody this, and just writing it out has helped me tremendously, but here:","i'm an egotistical, arrogant douche who ruined my chance with a wonderful girl, but worse, i may have hurt her, and deserve everything that i get coming from her."
109,"this happened a few nights ago, and i'm still trying to recuperate. so my friends and i had been planning this night several weeks prior and we were all really looking forward to it. but this night meant something more to me; the girl i've been interested in was coming and that was going to be the time for me to see if the feelings were mutual. i'll call her a.  

fast forward to about 6:30, 1 and a half hours before the ballroom opens. i'm at tacobell, eating more food than i should with a friend who's coming with me to the dancing. afterwards we head back to my place, hang out for a bit, and then get dressed for the night. 

right as i put on my slacks i know something is wrong. i haven't worn these in the longest time, and they completely constrict my lower intestine. i hear my gut gurgle, but despite my better judgement, i ignore it.

fast forward, i'm at the ballroom and having a fun time, and it is packed with people. having nothing in my bowels act up except for the slight discomfort of tight slacks, i decide it's now or never, and i go walk up to a. i ask her to dance and she gladly obliges. i've gone swing dancing before, so i begin to impress her with some of the dance moves i know. i then go to show her my favorite move, the pretzel, which includes some twisting of the arms and body plus a dip at the end i like to include. well, me being in the heat of the moment, i forget how tight the slacks are above my waist and i dip her. the dip then causes me to lean forward, causing the tight slacks to push immensely onto my lower intestine, causing 4 grande burritos worth of slimy shit to seep out my of ass and down my legs.

at this point i froze, still holding a in dipped position. she can tell something is wrong and asked ""powerpython, what happened?"" without thinking i drop her and quickly shuffle out of the ball room, leaving a trail of wet shit behind me. i hear her retch loudly over the music playing. i just drove home. i heard from my friends that they had to stop the dance and clean it up.

i'll never know if the feelings were mutual.","i ate a lot of tacobell, and ended up shitting myself while dancing with a girl i like."
110,"i was sitting across the room from my husband, both of us playing on around on our phones, when i decided it would be a good idea to send him a naughty photo i took for him.  i was feeling a little frisky, so i immediately opened up my text message icon and inserted the photo and sent the photo.  

i closed the screen and suddenly realized that the last person i texted was my very religious mother instead of my husband.  i panicked!  i started turning bright red and pacing back and forth in the living room trying to figure out how to undo the text.  i sent her a text that read ""please delete that, it was meant for [husband].""  i explained to my husband what i did and he took my phone from me.

thank goodness for 3g because the picture hadn't sent yet, so he turned the phone into airplane mode and then deleted the pending text.  my mother texted me back about an hour later and asked me what she needed to delete.  

my husband still gave me some because he thought it was hilarious that i was trying to turn him on and accidentally sent it to my mom.","i sent the naughty picture to my mother instead of husband, still got laid."
111,"beforehand, as a non native speaker i'm sorry for my poor english. corrections welcomed. 

back in december 2012, i had a shitty job that i was leaving. i already updated my résumé a few month earlier and showed it to my friends to check spelling, grammar & everything else. i was very confident that my résumé was perfect. when my contract actually ended, i just changed the dates of my last work experience : it was ""september 2011 - now"" and i changed ""now"" to january. 

i sent my pdf résumé to a lot of companies, and uploaded it to many job offers on different websites. and i know that europe is going through hard times, but i had even less feedback than i expected from them (and i didn't expect much). 

after some other events (family problems) i *finally* got an interview in a company recently. the guy ask me about my previous work experience. i tell him. he looks on my résumé he had printed and answers:
""you said your contract ended in january 2013 ? on your résumé it is written january 2012...""

only at this moment i realized that nobody ever checked my résumé after i changed the last dates, and even myself never really had a good look at it from this moment. i used the pdf file without opening it as an attachment in e-mails, or uploading it on websites. i was very confident that my friends checked every mistake, and of course the fact that i could screw up the fucking years on it never crossed my mind.","i have screwed up the dates on my résumé, so companies thought that i was unemployed for more than a year (instead of a few weeks) and i didn't notice for 3 months. i feel very stupid about it now."
112,"the thread below from /r/askreddit made me think of this story.  it's over 3,000 comments deep, but i still wanted to share the wisdom we gained that day without it getting buried.  i figured you guys would like this.

**warning : it's a long one!**  i'll break it into two parts, my fuck up, and the one the other guys did that made everyone forget about my drunken episode.

this happened several years ago.  my brother and i were at a large nerd convention (ya know, the ones where you can say ""i need a storm trooper"" and a dozen will come running?).  we had been coming to this convention for about 3 years or so and were getting pretty comfortable with our routine.  friday and saturday night was drunken werewolf night, and sunday was hangover and recovery day.

for those of you know haven't played werewolf, think of the game heads up seven up from when you were in elementary school, then add werewolves and lynchmobs.  villagers try to hang all the werewolves, and the werewolves try to eat all the villagers.  the villagers usually just end up hanging each other.  great game for former drama students.


so on the saturday night, each of us grab a 6-pack and head down to the basement of the hotel where there is about 500 people playing various games.  about 100 were playing werewolf, in about 5 different circles.  we get social and start making friends with our booze.  other people have booze, and we start trading.  after a lot of crown royal and each of us downing a 6-pack, one of our new ""friends"" offers us some 'mystery booze.'

he explained what it was - strega.  apparently it's some italian thing with like 76 different ingredients.  it tasted like mouthwash with a burning kick in the throat afterwards.  i drank a couple shots, but my brother took a lot more.  his reasoning was ""well i traded one from my 6-pack, and so that was like $3 worth, so i deserve more!""  i watched him chug at least 6 shots out of this thing, barely taking a breath.

fast forward about 10 minutes.  we're playing werewolf, and i can tell that i'm being waaaaaaaay too obnoxious, and everyone wishes that i would leave.  except for the guy sitting next to me, apparently (this was the guy with the strega).  when ""nighttime"" comes and the village goes to sleep (we all lower our heads to simulate sleeping), he reaches over and grabs my cock.  i think i handled it very well.  i just gently removed his hand and said ""dude, there's kids here...""

i didn't want to embarrass the guy and it was kinda my fault (apparently i give off a really gay vibe when i'm this drunk), i have a lot of gay friends and i know it's hard (heheh, phrasing) to find similarly minded people, so when the villagers decided to lynch me that night i drunkenly excused myself and left the game.  the guy ended up leaving with his, now empty, bottle of booze. this caused me to miss what happened next.

from my side of the room, i hear a splash and see about 20 people all stand up in unison, perform a perfectly in-synch 180, and jog away from the scene with a giant ""nope"" look on all their faces.  my brother had puked all over the game area.  with no other players remaining, he declared victory for the werewolves.

15 minutes later, we're in the bathroom, and i'm telling him all the disgusting things i can think of to get him to throw up more.  these include things like,

""hey, let's go upstairs and get an ashtray sandwich!""  or

""just think about going down on mom...""

that one worked really well...  somewhere i have a video of him crying while puking and proclaiming ""stop, i'm vomiting tears!""

with the help of one of the convention volunteers, we make it back to our rooms, where i pass out next to the door for about an hour.  i finally make it to bed around 6am, and sleep straight though to 2pm.  i awake to the worst hangover of my life.  i had to pound several energy drinks to get rid of the headache, but by 6pm or so i'm good.  my brother apparently had a similar experience in his room.

we decided not to continue our werewolf games on sunday, and kept ourselves from even showing our faces in the game room for the rest of the convention.

** 



**part 2** - on monday, we're getting ready to leave the convention and we run into one of the guys that helped us out when we were both puking.  he told us that everyone completely forgot about saturday night because of what happened the next night.

11pm or so, sunday night, down in the game room there were these two drunk guys.  they're being real assholes and are asked to leave the game.  they finally give in and get up, only to stick around because the one guy's gf showed up.  he picks her up, throws her on the table, lifts her skirt and starts doin it right there...  in front of a mixed crowd with ages ranging from 8 to 60.

apparently that's the line at this particular convention.  the con's security escorts them upstairs where the one guy is threatening to beat the shit out of the hotel manager, while the other declares that ""you can't hold us, i'm in the military!""  so the security guy asks for their military ids.  he writes down the information and informs them that he'll be calling their cos.

the guys start freaking out.  security takes them out back into this little courtyard area while they wait for the head of security to show up.  guy starts picking up gravel and throwing it at the windows of the hotel.  he finally crossed the line when he took a chair and tried to pry to fire door open with one of the legs.  this set off the fire alarm.

turns out that the fire department was already there, finishing up after a fire in the elevator on the 26th floor.  with that, the cops got involved.

**tl:dr** - drunk guy fucks his gf in front of an 8 year old.  gets fire department, cops, and his co called on him.","** - drank mystery booze, got groped, and my brother won a game by puking.  don't drink strega!!!"
113,"okay so this morning i got up late for class and decided that i could skip a shower and just do the ol' wet-my-hair-down-and-put-a-shit-ton-of-deodorant-on-to-make-it-seem-like-i-showered. it worked well enough and my day went on normally. 

after class i get a text from my new-ish hot girlfriend (almost a month) asking me if i wanted to go on a dinner date. hell yes! with this girl, if i pay for dinner and she has a good time, she gets my man gravy for dessert if you know what i mean.

anyway, it's about half an hour before i have to go and pick her up and i figure that i should do a pre-date shit so i don't end up in the bathroom at the restaurant for 45 minutes because i had a double baconator for lunch (i know, fuck my fat ass...). so i'm sitting on the toilet and i scratch my balls and do a sniff test like everyone does when they take a shit. not fucking good. my scrotum smelt of aged swiss cheese from a fancy-pants gourmet restaurant. i was thinking, ""shit! she's not going to want a hunk of floppy swiss in her mouth, not without wine! and i don't have enough time for a shower!"" so i do the most logical thing of course, i grab the bottle of febreze next to the toilet and spray it on my dick.

ya done fucked up now m0t0rb04t!

i had a boner from thinking of the blowie i was going to receive later, so my pee-hole was wide open. as the febreze dripped down my shaft shoot, it felt like a thousand needles. this was supposed to be lavender and vanilla comfort, not vanilla fire! i tried to force some piss out to try and wash it out but that hurt 100 times more. my eyes were watering and i was trying my hardest not to scream; it was the worst pain ever!

so i ended up cancelling the date because ""i really had to work on homework."" she kinda got pissed but whatever, there was no way i was going to blow my febreze load on her face tonight.",i missed out on a blow job because i sprayed febreze down my urethra.
114,"this wasn't today but last thursday. 

i was asked to join a new group of friends for drinks. i haven't drank alcohol for about a month for various reasons and i was very behind on sleep, but i still wanted to join them.

so the night starts off normal until i decide to stop mixing my drinks and pouring straight admiral nelson. i must have misjudged my tolerance and blacked out halfway through the night...which has never happened to me. apparently i had filled up my cup two more times after blacking out, and ended up puking the night away. i now owe a handle of admiral and left my dignity on the bathroom floor where i sat butt-naked for the night..","new acquaintances, drink silly amounts of alcohol, made a great first impression and have initiated myself into the group by getting plastered. now owe a handle of admiral, and am nicknamed 180."
115,"this is my first time submitting a post to reddit, so bear with me as i no doubt make an arse of the formatting. i'm also warning you that this post is fucking horrible and involves not only a lot of blood where it shouldn't be, but a detailed description of my penis-cleaning procedure.  
  
i keep some baby wipes in the bathroom. they make wiping after a hefty shit a breeze, and i like to use them to give the old cock a good wipe after taking a piss. you know, for that extra minty freshness. it was 23:30. nature called, and i answered. i pulled my skin far back for a good clean, and thought nothing of it, as it wasn't out of the ordinary for me. my cock is battle hardened — it can take some punishment.  
  
drip.  
  
i looked down to find a nice little drop of blood about two centimetres in diameter. and then another. and then another. and they just kept coming. it was none of your watery papercut blood — this was thick and dark crimson. it meant business. i was now powering through the wipes at an alarming rate, with one hand trying to stop the flood in vain, and the other furiously wiping the floor. and it just wouldn't stop. the bleeding continued for several minutes, with my toilet looking like a really creative murder scene. the floor was still covered. my hands were a lost cause. the toilet still had some lingering blood creeping around even after several flushes.  
  
the bleeding finally slowed enough for me to get a good look at the damage. i guess i was just too harsh with my cleaning, as that little line of skin on the underside of the head was bearing a sizeable tear. i don't know how much blood i lost, but my penis was looking awfully pale by the end of the ordeal. i ended up cleaning most of the bathroom so not as to risk being discovered, before heading to bed wearing the darkest coloured boxer-briefs i could find. bathroom-related bleeding is something you never want to share. well, except for with the entire internet!  
",i had a penis period.
116,"last night, by boyfriend and i got a pizza, and when we got back, i took the the pizza upstairs while he went to park the car. his designated lot is a good 15 minute walk from my complex, so i was left with the challenge of keeping the pizza warm while i waited for him to return. 

no problem, i would just put the oven on warm and place the pizza inside. i'd done it a thousand times at my parents house, so i didn't think this would be any different.

here's the catch: this is a dorm apartment, and the oven is half the size of a normal oven.

here's the other catch: the buildings is close to 40 years old, so this oven also happens to be gas. 

perhaps you see where this is going, because i didn't.

since the oven is small, and the pizza box covered the entire shelf from end to end, the sides of the box that were touching the inside of the oven proceeded to burn, smolder, and - when i noticed the smoke and removed the box from the oven - catch fire. i began frantically snuffing the fire out with various oven mitts and kitchen cloths whilst praying that the flame didn't ignite any residual grease that might be present on my stove top. fortunately, it didn't. 

i eventually got the fire out, leaving a carpet of cardboard ash all over my kitchen floor and i was now faced with a new problem. 

the smoke.

my tiny apartment was now filled from wall to wall with smoke. (as we all know, cardboard is one of the smokiest flammable substances on the planet). i'm very small, and i'm now rushing about, scrambling to move furniture away from the windows because some genius designed them without a screen and to open toward the inside. all the while, i'm choking on smoke, and my eyes are watering so bad its hard to see.

at this point, i'm now beginning to panic that at any moment, my smoke alarm is going to go off, which, were this to happen, would succeed in evacuating the entire complex, and end in me paying a large fee to the university, and probably one to the fire department as well. to add to this, i have a large number of empty alcohol bottles waiting to go out and larger number of full ones in my fridge. being a dry campus and me being only 20 years old, this could also cause termination to my housing contract. surely, these containers would be discovered upon investigation of the cause for alarm. (usually no ra ever even visits my floor, and the room is only inspected once per semester for safety).

fortunately for me, the smoke alarm in my apartment is located in the bedroom, and i managed to air the place out without causing it to go off. 

i was lucky enough to survive the ordeal with nothing but an ashy kitchen, a burnt throat (it still hurts a little to breath in too deeply), and an apartment in which everything smells very pungently of smoke (this is the best part, because my clothes now all smell like a campfire).

somehow, in a very lucky turn of events, the pizza was okay.","tried to warm a pizza, smoked out my entire apartment."
117,"my first post on reddit and it's in tifu.  figures.

so this actually happened yesterday, but since it was less than 24 hours ago i figured it still counts.  
  i left my apartment to go pick up my kid and do some shopping for a sick friend.  as i was pulling out of my complex, i realized that i forgotten my phone.  seeing as though i was still in the parking lot, i pulled around and rather than park in a space, i decided to leave my car running behind a few cars parked in front of my building.  now, recently my car has been doing this things where the electric locks (which have been fried for a while) have been randomly engaging while i drive.  this wouldn't be too much of a problem except that the lock mechanism itself in the drivers side door is screwed up so its really hard to unlock from inside.  so i unlock my door, get out of the car and shut the door behind me.  then thinking better of it, i decide to leave the door open a little so it doesn't randomly lock me out.  it was too late.  i was locked out of my car for 90 minutes, and the whole time the engine was running. my kid ended up having to get a ride home with her friend and i was late to pick up my gf.   stupid locks.","shut the locked door (that i thought was unlocked) with keys in the ignition and car running, waited 90 minutes to get it unlocked."
118,"this was on australia day but that wasn't long ago. we are drinking to celebrate our overtaking of this great southern land and we are in the pool (awesome in ground one, 2 metres deep). i invent a new drinking game where you take your bottle of beer, hold it in your mouth and have to swim underwater to the other side and then finish it off when you submerge. it was awesome, went without a hitch! no pool water got in and i was a hero. 

i got cocky and went for a return pass to the other side, this time i didn't take as much care (hell it worked last time so its a sure thing) and i think quite a bit of pool water got in. all was hilarious and we kept drinking.

fast forward to the night and i had stomach cramps to the point where i nearly shit the bed (doesn't matter if i did anyways, counter is still 0000). there were some close calls but there were many trips to the bathroom. i'm fine now but it was an awful night.","invented a game where you swim underwater with your beer. drank some pool water, liquid shit all night."
119,"(long but worth a read)

so i'm in grade 12 chemistry class and as a part of our final independent study project (isu) each of us was to choose a pre-designed experiment that was deemed a 'magic trick' and perform it for a class of grade 9 students. my magic trick was called methane bubbles. link to an example for those of you who are unfamiliar with the experiment, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqxonsakr6y this was also done on mythbusters i believe. 
    
 anyway, i was practising the experiment at lunchtime when a very large group of bubbles was caught up on the ceiling, but these were from a girl not in my class who had selected the same project. being the gentleman that i am i decided to go light them for her. when the supervising teacher saw what i was about to do he sort of mumbled 'yeah you could do that i guess' without really looking. so i lit it on fire and this massive fireball radiated out along the ceiling, maybe 6 feet in diameter, i could feel the heat from it. just as the 30 some odd people let out a collective 'ahhh' admiring my work, black water explodes out of the ceiling and starts spraying everywhere, the fire alarm goes off. as some people are getting sprayed with the mysterious black water, a panic ensues and the teacher who ok'ed the thing yells ""everyone get out"", the funny thing was that he was probably the second person out of the room. 
     
the whole school (~1200 people, less at lunch) is evacuated (people seemed extra pissed off) and it was -20 c outside and there was a wind chill. fire and emt crew show up and enter the school. as i am standing outside watching it all unfold i see the ambulance leave for the hospital with two people in it. the people outside are ordered to move to a nearby recreation centre to stay warm (most of them didn't have their coats) but part of the school was reopened half an hour later. none of my afternoon classes started after a while so i went home feeling guilty and excited. for the rest of the day i would occasionally break out into laughter just thinking about it. my dad asked me how my day was when he got home. when i said 'i sort of set the school on fire', well, the look on his face was priceless.
     
the next day i find out about the people who went to the hospital. one was my physics teacher who had a panic/asthma attack during the whole thing and the other was a guy who was in the room at the time but accidentally spilled fake blood and hydrogen peroxide on his face (part of his magic trick he was practising) seconds before my explosion went off. you can see why the physics teacher freaked out. both of them are fine now. i also found out that the science rooms had been flooded in about a foot of water which leaked below into the library destroying most of the ceiling tiles but no books or computers. 
   

i was deemed a hero by some who had tests postponed and the magic tricks were never performed. i haven't heard the official ruling on what exactly went wrong but the water was black because it was rusty from the sprinkler system. neither myself nor my chemistry teacher are in trouble because it was a ministry approved experiment. i was a bad idea on my part anyway.
     i write my chem exam tomorrow, i'm certain that i'll lose crappy marks, i talked to my teacher actually and we are on good terms. 
     on a side note, there is no foreseeable end to the 'don't set that on fire' jokes.

 

edit: paragraph spacing","my chem experiment gone wrong breaks the ceiling, evacuates school in -20 c weather, floods several rooms and the library and sends 2 people to the hospital during lunchbreak (worth read for the story behind it)"
120,"(took place last week)
i went over to the suite of my good friend/occasional hookup partner to pick up a book i had lent her.  she wasn't there and i really had to shit so i used the bathroom in her suite.  naturally i played a few turns in words with friends while i pooped.  
i stood up to wipe and put my phone on the toilet paper dispenser when someone played their turn, causing my phone to vibrate and promptly fall into the toilet.  
i quickly rescued my phone from the shitwater and immediately opened it up to see if i could rescue it.  i then ran into her room and panickedly threw the pieces of the phone on the first flat surface i could find, which happened to be her bed.  she had returned while i was shitting, and i was only halfway through my explanation when she realized that shitwater (i can confirm that this phone smelled fucking foul) was staining her bed, whereupon she kicked me in the balls, pushed me out of the room, and locked the door.  and that's the story of how i found out she was extremely germaphobic.

 
edit: punctuation sucks",; i drowned my phone in shitwater and threw it on a poor girl's bed.

122,"there are a few main people in this story; me, james, and xavier, austin, brian, and zack

the story of october 19th:

(tl;dr at the end)

it all started out six months ago with my group of friends at my school on a monday morning. the whole group was there (the names listed above) and james had just gotten to school. he comes up to the group and tells us ""i can't wait until october 19th"". no one in the group knew what this met at all, and throughout the week, james kept on repeating ""october 19th, i can't wait"". we'd ask him ""james, what the fuck happens on october 19th?"" and he wouldn't tell us. he would just say things like ""you'll see. you'll all see'""

because james kept saying all these things over and over about october 19th, we decide to start making an inside joke with me and my friends that james is gonna shoot up the school, james is gonna bring a gun to school, stuff along those lines. we never said it to anyone outside the group ever. 

fast forward to the afternoon of october 18th. xavier and austin ride the same bus home, so they sit together everyday on the ride home. sitting behind them was a freshmen girl, who over heard what xavier and austin were saying about james and about the next day, but it was all still an inside joke with me and my friends. that freshmen girl went home that day and told her mom what she over heard xavier and austin talking about.

that same afternoon, we were all in skype, and james tells us that the surprise for tomorrow was that he was going to disneyland. and sure enough, about ten minutes later, james was on the road headed for california. (we live in arizona, so california's only five-six hours away).

that night, at around eleven, i was about to lay down and go to bed, when i get a phone call from james. i answer it, and james is freaking out. i guess james and xavier were on skype that night, and the police called xavier's house, and told him that the police were coming to investigate the supposed school shooting tomorrow, october 19th. they said that swat was coming to our school, and the whole group was under arrested for conspiracy to commit murder. at first i thought it was a joke, but i got a call about five minutes after i hung up on james from the police telling me they wanted to ask me questions. 

since xavier was the one that was talking about october 19th on the bus, and the freshmen girl overheard him specifically talking about it, the police went to xavier's house and questioned him about october 19th. 

the next day, police were at my school, about ten officers maybe. they questioned all of us about october 19th, and somehow, xavier ended up getting all of the blame. he's still being charged to this day with minor charges and two felonies. i don't know what legally is still going on besides that, but yea. zack, brian, and austin got lucky and nothing happened to them at all. that's the story of october 19th. never joke about school shootings.","me and my friends made an inside joke about our friend shooting up the school, someone overheard, told the police, and my friend is still being charged with two felonies."

so we rock up at this bartending gig, i've never done it before. say hi to everyone, and the dad running the show is a bit of a dick to me and my friend. apparently he's a pretty straight edge guy, but these older dudes love to smash scotch. still quite religious and serious. so we get working and have a few sneaky beverages here and there. we're having loads of fun and the people invited are enjoying our antics and stuff. talk heaps with all these people, a few being my parent's friends and stuff. anyways, we start getting tipsy, but we're a good team and killing it as it gets real busy. the older guys are loving it, but we're getting pretty drunk. we're super fun and the party is clearly at the bar. the girl notices and is judging me hard as i ask her what drink she wants and she rudely replies ""um, i don't even drink"". (you know it that super arrogant way)

anyways we peak a bit too early and things start going downhill. it's noticeable how tipsy we are, and the dad tells me off. i'm like fuck that guy. so we throw down a few more drinks. by now we're trashed, but i can act classy and hold my shit together. my friend however cannot. he's got those real drunk eyes cranking and people are noticing how fucked we are. start messing up drinks and stuff. then my mate drops a whole unopened bottle of vodka without realising. i try clean it up and i drop a huge chunk of glass making it worse. someone gets us food and i end up destroying my dad's shirt with it.

so in our hammered state we think it'll be genius to stash a bottle or 2 in the garden out back to nick at the end. just to clarify i'm not ever such a scumbag, but in our drunken state this seemed pretty genious. then we start cleaning up and stuff. i'm feeling pretty bad so i help out pretty well and hide my drunkness. the older guys organising are happy. however my friend is absolutely fucked at this point and gets caught stealing a bottle. i rescue him and somehow talk my way out of it. eventually i get our dosh and my friend's dad picks us up. my friend even tells him to ""prime the car as we stole shit"". we get away and celebrate our victory.

the ultimate fuck up? me sending a picture bragging of stealing shit to everyone on my snapchat. including the girl who got me the job. fuck



**","** got trashed while getting paid at a wedding for some religious people, ruined my dad's shirt, stole shit and then sent a picture to the chick organising it about the whole ordeal."
124,"so i'm at the office going on a usual mid week coffee bender which usually consists of three cups before lunch. i take my lunch break and have a smoke after. for those that don't smoke, drink coffee, or both, the coffee is the primer and the cig pulls the plug. so i go upstairs to the 26th floor where i work and head for the bathroom. of course the cleaning lady has to be in there so i clench the cheeks for a good half hour. after she leaves i head in there and plop down ready to. as soon as the porcelain and skin make contact the door opens. i get the nervous poop syndrome so i immediately try to hold it all in till the co worker leaves. trying my hardest, a bunch of loud farts start shooting at at rapid fire echoing off the bowl making it ten times louder. i'm talking 25 toots in 8 seconds. i lost my state of mind and jammed my hand in the bowl trying to cover my poop hole like its some sort of plausible option and i can stop the gas leak.  wrong. the deuce shot out. blasted my hand and i almost puked. 

waited for the co worker to leave. used about a roll of toilet paper, walked to my desk. pokerface.jpg. act like it never happened.",thought my butt hole could be pluged like putting your thumb over a tiny hole in a garden hose.
125,"just a little background information first to get it out of the way. my boyfriend and i see each other once a week if we're lucky so when we do  we usually get down to some dirty business after getting food and wandering around, stuff like that. i'm an eighteen year old female and he is a nineteen year old male, both legal where we live, just saying. needless to say, today was no different. 

started off the date by going to a sushi buffet, then went shopping (got a wondrous deal on clothing thanks to a friend, completely unrelated), and ended up at his place. so we're casually watching some television, occasionally engaging in some makeout seshes here and there, then things started to get steamy. also, forgot to mention, we ordered pizza beforehand. so of course, the pizza guy arrives while we're halfway through doing the deed, and boyfriend has to go downstairs to pay for the pizza, while he has a boner. then, after gorging ourselves on more food, we recommence the sexy times -- only to have his grandpa walk in on us (he was mad about the dog peeing in the bathroom or something along those lines). also, the boyfriend doesn't have a lock on his bedroom door so, yeah. thinking quickly, the boyfriend reaches over and covers us both with the blanket, effectively concealing us from his grandpa's sight. 

you'd think that any normal person would realize what's going on, laugh, and leave the room, right? wrong. his grandpa proceeds to walk into the room while we're both under the covers almost shitting ourselves, and he starts patting at us from above the covers. full out grabbing at, what he probably sees as a giant blob underneath the covers. i'm pretty sure at one point he grabbed my head, can't really remember (in denial). anyways, a lot of shouting ensued and the grandpa left.

pretty sure i can't go back there ever again. 

edit: boyfriend did not give the pizza guy the d.",had accidental threesome with boyfriend's grandpa.
126,"one fine summer day 20 years ago my best friend & i decided to go to the mall. i was 13, it was the early 90's & so i decided to wear a [cropped shirt](http://img0.etsystatic.com/001/1/6387571/il_fullxfull.363369264_jqz8.jpg) sans bra since, well, i was not really in need of one yet. (it was also arizona in the summer so the less clothing the better...usually). 

in this mall the food court overlooked a good-size arcade. we looked around for games we wanted to play, making our plan of attack and then we saw it. this new incredible ride. the [gyroorbitron](http://new-jersey-amusement-rides.com/interactive-ride-photos/gyroorbitron.jpg). it was early so it wasn't open yet and we got in line first. 

i love rides, especially ones that you go upside down on so i insisted that i was first. so there am i, getting strapped in looking up at all the people looking down on me with curiosity at this new contraption. the ride operator asks me, ""all set?"" i reply with an emphatic, ""yep!"" and away i went upside down...with my shirt over my head. 

dead silence. the ride stops with my shirt still over my head. i pull it down and the operator (trying not to look at me) asks if i want to get off the ride early. i'm totally mortified and didn't want to be more embarrassed by quitting so i tucked my shirt into my waist band and finished my time.",wore tiny shirt on a new ride & flashed a bunch of strangers.
127,"i am near sighted, and i can only recognize things by shape and color when i don't have my glasses on. my eyes were pretty dry this morning, so i went to put a few eye drops in. i had forgotten that i had an ear wax dissolvent bottle that looked exactly the same shape and size of my eye drop bottle. i thought i had my eye drop bottle, but i had somehow grabbed the eax wax dissolvent bottle. i put one drop in and felt immediate pain. i rushed to the bathroom and rinsed my eye out for a good 5 minutes, and i took a wet cloth and dabbed my eye every now and than for about an hour. i still have a dull pain in my eye after a few hours, but its nothing i can't handle. it's definitely not the way i wanted to start off my morning.",don't put ear wax dissolvent in your eye
128,"so i work as an intern at a bank and on fridays most people go home early. well last friday my boss and i were practically the only ones in the still in the office after lunch so she allowed my to go home early, but offered to pay me for a full day. i've never been paid for not working before so i was stoked. i finished up my lunch, packe up my stuff and left. the following monday (yesterday), i received and email from the department that is responsible for paying me to approve last weeks online time card (i get paid by the hour) and let them know if anything is incorrect. my timecard still showed me leaving at 1:00 on friday and i was supposed to get paid for a full day so i emailed them back saying to change my out time to 4:30 because my boss said it was okay. fast forward to this morning, and my boss tells me that she just got an angry call asking why she approved me to get paid for 3.5 hours that i wasn't working.",apparently my boss was doing me a solid that she could get in trouble for and i went and told on her (by accident).
129,"*spoiler:  there's no shit in this story*

so for a bit of context here.  i live in missouri, in the us.  i'm a guy in my late 20s and i work 3rd shift.

i was meeting my friend so we could watch a movie at her place.  she was just getting off work, and i was about 10 min early to her place.  but i didn't want to just wait in my car, so i kept driving down the road.  got to a point when i needed to turn around, so i went down a side street to do a u-turn.  my turn radius on my car sucks a bit, so i had to stop and and put it in reverse.  i stopped a couple feet from a lightpost and some combination of my brain or body fucked up and didn't put my car and reverse, smashed the gas pedal and dented up my front bumper and hood.  and maybe the radiator. 

on the plus side, i didn't get any tickets from the police that ended up showing up randomly.  no asking if i was drunk, or if i could walk a straight line.

if i remember, i'll try to post a pic.

 

edit, i suck at spoiler tags.","i hit a stationary object and fucked up my car, because i was 10 min early to a friend's house**"
130,"just a normal day, at my friends house trying to take a shit. so i go to the bathroom, to take my shit,  because that's where i usually take my shits.  get into the usual position, take out my phone with my left hand and hold my dick down with my right so i can piss in the toilet.  yea you guys know how it works. as i'm scrolling down the reddit front page with my left hand, this massive mosquito comes out of nowhere and starts trying to make out with my face,  and what do you know. i panic. instead of using my free left hand i use my dominant right hand in an attempt to swat the fucker away(when i could have used my free left hand the whole time) , and as i am windmill swatting the massive blood sucker, my dick is left to roam free. . (guys reading should know what happens. .) fucking fire hose action initiates. my dick just starts flailing around, shooting urine everywhere. there's piss on the toilet seat, my pants, the floor, my left leg,  the worst part is that the mosquito disappeared so i'm covered in piss and paranoid. so instead of enjoying my shit,  i had to erupt it from my ass, wipe my ass clean as fast as i could, and get my ass out of there.  on the good side though i marked my territory on his bathroom rug.",pissed on myself because it was too damn hot in this house.
131,"little bit of background: winter 2013 college semester i started to fall for this girl that i meet through a mutual friend. fast forward to a week after school gets out, she goes home for the summer and i start working third shift, gotta make the money, so she breaks up with me. a week later she starts going out with her friend from back home who she ""wanted to go out before but didn't want to get into a ld relationship, but its cool now because this year he will be going to a local community college that is near the college we go to.""

ok, now back to today, yesterday ex-gf wants to hang out for a bit as we are going to try to just be friends as there wasn't much relationship before we broke up. so i hang out with her and the old feelings resurface in me, time to gtfo and have some whiskey. 

so today i went to football tailgating at the college i go to, hot greek little sister walks up with her friend ""hey bigwag91, this is my friend hotgurl, blah blah blah, she just got out of a two year relationship. she is just looking to hang out. had i not been thinking about last night (or maybe the hangover of today) i would have seen this as a total green light on hotgurl. later hotgurl is talking to me alot giving little hints that i should have noticed but i couldn't muster myself together enough to take these hints and lay some moves on hotgurl.

later on i ended up having to go up to here and apologize for acting like a complete idiot in front of her and we got to talking. ex lovers, friends, interests, etc, etc. the ex lovers part was the worst cause after talking for 45-60 minutes she looks and me and goes ""you will find someone, don't worry"" but gives major hints that i missed my chance. 

 

p.s. ""today"" is actually yesterday

edit: it's still 2013, was hoping it was closer to my graduation","ex-gf used me as a place holder, shit on my heart, hung out with me yesterday, and stuck in my head today when i could have done something with hotgurl."
132,"okay, first of all this an old story and i just thought this would be the perfect place to tell it. this happened in high school, as everything does. 
so i used to take the school bus home from school, and the bus ride was the best part of the day, because me and my friends were always up to something stupid, there are many bus stories i could tell you, but let's focus on this one. so as per usual me and my friends are being idiots and nobody on the bus really cares because they're used to it. you see i realize now that i didn't make this decision consciously, but rather it was inspired from a memory deep in my subconscious. a long time ago, i watched the movie speed with keanu reeves and sandra bullock, (yeah you know exactly where this is going) so for some reason i thought i would re-enact the events of the most memorable scene in my opinion. so we were driving down a really busy road in my city, and we always sat at the back of the bus so here's what i did. i got a piece of paper (from what i remember, this is the only writing i did all day) and a sharpie and wrote quite clearly; help! bomb on bus! yeah, i did that, guess what else i'm an indian guy. fucking perfect right, now in my defence every car that saw the sign laughed at it because they saw me making the dumbest face ever and all my friends laughing and joking, but then there was this one blonde (hair color has no relevance, just painting a picture)  that was probably having a bad day or something because she didn't laugh, matter of fact instead of going where she was headed, she followed the bus all the way to my bus stop, she waited until she saw me get up to get out of her car. up until this point me and my friends were joking around but when the black honda civic door opened the laughter stopped and i heard a ""you're fuuucked"" in unison. whatever. before i can even get off of the bus she climbs onto the the bus, and i shit you not, these are her exact words, you wouldn't forget them either.

blonde lady: ""is everyone alright?""
everyone: ""yeeah....""
blonde lady: ""is there a bomb on the bus?""
scrooge: *facepalm* x9000

she then proceeds to tell the bus driver, who already hates my guts, that i am a threat to national security and need to be dealt with. this led to my suspension; 1 week from school, 1 month from the bus. the ass kicking i got....oh man, don't even get me started.","put a sign that said 'bomb on bus' on the back window of my school bus, and a crazy white bitch followed me to my stop to save the day."
133,"so today was my first day at work. i was told to be there at 8:00am. naturally, i didn't want to fuck up and be late, so i went to bed early and got some sleep so i can get up at 6:50am and get there earlier. you know, just in case something happens. 

i wake up at 6:50 this morning, i take a nice hot shower and get ready slowly just because i've got so much time. at 7:15am, my boss calles me and asks me why i'm not at work yet. i tell her it's only 7:15, and that she told me to be there at 8...

she then proceeds to tell me that it's 8:15am right now because of daylight savings time.

apparently, my country decided to extend daylight savings time by a month and a half or something. being on reddit all day, i didn't even know this happened, so my phone's clock decided to move itself an hour backwards.

needless to say, i was ~30 minutes late to my first day at work.",daylight savings time is fucking retarded.**
134,"so my friends and i went to venice beach and we all got fairly high. i have a lowest tolerance of all my smoking buddies, so when we were finished, they were all good, but i was feeling quite dizzy. as we were leaving, i started feeling worse and worse in the car ride and i felt as if my skin was melting and the car was going at light speeds. all of this lead to my mind telling me ""i need to fucking throw up right now"", so i obliged, but thought, hey it would be a great idea to roll down the window first before throwing up. sounds great right? nope, turns out throwing up while on the freeway with the window open causes the barf to come flying back in and hitting the person sitting behind you. everyone in the car got a little damage from my vile, but my friend sitting behind me had it the worst. after we had gotten back she told me that it had gotten in her mouth.","threw up while on the freeway with the window open, only to have it come back into the car and go into my friend's mouth."
135,"yesterday was canadian thanksgiving, and instead of having the usual beaver drizzled in maple syrup (kidding) i ate a traditional meal with a bit of a twist. instead of turkey we had raw chunks of prime beef with a pasty sauce comprised of dried hot peppers and whisky. the good whisky.

anyways, turns out my stomach can't handle a meal meant for an african warrior who just killed a zebra with his 14 inch long johnson, so of course i got a little sick.

i decided to be a dumbass, and told myself i'd go to school no matter what. i skip breakfast, because i know i can't hold anything down at this point, and go to school. one period later and i'm cancelling a lunch date, asking for homework, and calling home.

fast forward another hour and the bus (ttc, reppin toronto transit) drops me off 100m from the house. that was the second longest hundred meters (328.084 feet) in my life.

i got home and felt like shit, so i took a shit. and what a shit it was, the toilet will be stained for days. after i was done spewing out my intestines, i walked down to the kitchen.

remembering my training, i knew i was supposed to prescribe fluids to my sorry ass. so, i drank half a glass of water.

before i could say ""sweet relief"" i began to projectile vomit like a firehose.

i ran upstairs, mouth over my hands, and i *swear* to you i could hear the gushing as the yellow fluid sprayed the stairs, the hardwood floor, the tiling in my bathroom, my bathroom mirror, and finally the sink.

i then proceeded to vomit my stomach acid out, feeling the burn as i did so. and it wasn't a gentle *bleugh*, it was a steady stream which looked like i was taking a piss from my mouth.

after the trauma was over, i wiped the hardwood and mirror, washed the sink a bit, and realized i'm gonna need a carpet cleaner. 

i have just finished watching catch me if you can, and i still can't be bothered to find out where i can get one. wish me luck reddit, i have a huge presentation tomorrow and a math assignment, let's see if i can stop spewing for enough time for me to finish.","got sick trying to eat raw meat, sprayed nearly a tenth of my square footage with watery orangish-yellow fluids."
136,"for context, i'm 5' 6-1/2"" and 143 pounds (just got measured).

my company does a health risk assessment to give people incentives to be healthy. they take your height, weight, blood draw, etc. and if you are healthy you get money off of your premiums each month.

so mine was today. i did everything well and fasted before hand.

a buddy of mine had his today too. we decided we should celebrate it by going out and getting a bunch of food. i decided to try and eat whatever he ate. we called it a ""celebration"".

we decided today that pancheros (like chipotle if you don't have one nearby) was the place of choice. the challenge was to eat 2 burritos in one sitting. these are no baby burritos if you haven't been there before. these suckers are probably 1-1.5 lbs a piece. i should also mention my buddy is about 6' 1"" and 250+ lbs.

we decided to go for it, and holy shit does my stomach regret it. i successfully ate both, but i, for some stupid reason, decided to get jalapenos on mine, so that's in the mix. i haven't stopped burping or farting since eating it, and my stomach is brewing something awful.

the worst part is yet to come when i have this sloppy mud-butt shit at work. it's gonna be a real butthole burner.

never, ever, eat 2 pancheros burritos in one sitting. and if you do, don't get jalapenos on them.",going to melt a toilet later with red-hot magma shits
137,"my worst nightmare has come true. i papercut my eye with about 15 pages of paper. i got to an optometrist right away, and was able to take [a picture of a picture they took](http://i.imgur.com/dgkegv4.jpg). the yellowy bit is the damaged area. a papercut to the eye, particularly of this magnitude, hurts at least as much as you'd imagine.",good idea: do work. bad idea: unwittingly papercut your eye.
138,"today, a lot of my extended family was over for thanksgiving dinner.  i spent my summer working in kenya and i haven't seen a lot of family since i've been back, so i decided to grab my laptop and show them some of my photos.  what i had forgotten was that last night i fell asleep after watching some porn and i hadn't touched my laptop since; luckily i had made the effort of closing the actual porn website, but i hadn't gone as far as the pop-up ads... so i had to clumsily close down three sexual pop up ads (two ""live cams"" and some adult dating site) while my aunts, uncles, grandmother and great grandmother watched.",four generations of family members feeling awkward because i didn't close my porn pop-ups.
139,"biggest scare of my life, i almost died today.

  i have been training at work as an electrical/electronics technician.  i got burned on my hand today at work during a factory shut down from an arc flash made up of 480 volts of electricity and i don't know how many amps (i know it's a lot though, because it was the main disconnect for the entire machine). i was cleaning out one of the cabinets for a machine at work when it happened. i was blowing an air compressor into the main disconnect of the machine, and had an arc flash burned me. 
  for those who don't know, when a machine is turned off and has gone through the lock out, tag out procedure, you need to verify that power is off using a volt meter at the source, otherwise it is considered hot (there is still electricity). i am not electrically certified by the company to use a volt meter to check if there is no power, so someone else who is certified usually does it. also, under normal conditions, you would never go near the top of the disconnect, because it still has power, unless a different disconnect going to that disconnect is turned off, then there is absolutely no power there. that didn't happen today, during the factory shut down.  no one who is certified told me there was absolutely no power coming anywhere, and no one tested it.  but why would there be during a factory shut down right?
  power was on, and when my air compressor went near one of the top terminals, the arc went across the barrel of the gun, not up it, which saved my life. the hole in the gun was the size of a .22 caliber bullet, and that could have been my arm, my leg, or even my chest. the flash blinded me for a few seconds, and when i could see and hear again, i looked at my pain filled left hand, and saw that some skin was peeled off, like a popped blister would look. 
 two co-workers came running over, had me sit, and then everyone and there mother showed up and looked to see what the loud noise was. i was sent to first aid and got wrapped up w/ some ice, which stopped my hand from cooking any more than it already did. once that was done, i was driven to the hospital to get checked out.
 i passed all of my drug, hearing, and heart rate tests, and the doc said i was lucky to just get a flash burn, all it is is a bad sun burn with a popped blister. i am very, very, very lucky to not have an electrical burn (look it up if you like), or even worse, and i have another check up tomorrow. i am not mad at anyone, just happy to be okay. i only ask that you make sure you don't take life and what you do for granted, because you never know if you may be closer to danger than i was. 

be safe my friends.","big bang, little boo boo."
140,"this is probably the stupidest thing i think i have ever done. at least i feel like it.

a little background, i had a great weekend which didn't include a lot of sleep, so that is a factor. i also drive a standard (stick), which will also come into play.

anyways, going into work this morning and stopping at 7-11 for a coffee. the grade of the parking lot is maybe 1%, probably less heading back into the road. pull up in front of the store, grab a coffee and a clif bar as i skipped breakfast for the sake of sleep. got up to the counter, made my purchase, and turn to head out side. i notice my car going backward, about halfway through the parking lot now. first thing i think is ""someone is seriously stealing my car right now"", but wait, there's no one in the driver seat. as i'm running out to grab my car it dawns on me that i failed to get the car in gear to stop it from rolling. and yes, no e-brake was on either.

the situation on the road was blocked cars waiting for the light to turn green. at the halfway point where my car was at, light turns green, cars in my car's path get out of the way... barely. the cars behind those, thankfully, saw my moving vehicle, and were honking with no response...

until they see me running into the road, hop in my car and drive back into the 7-11. and after about .5 seconds of me comprehending everything, i promptly left the 7-11 to probably never return. i have never felt so stupid.","didn't leave my car in gear when i went to get coffee, car rolled into the road, but caused no major damage other than my pride."
141,"so my family and i went out for dinner as my mum and younger sister had just come back off holiday. i wanted something a little different than my usual gammon and chips, and i didn't have long to order so i just chose a simple burger and chips. (what can go wrong?!) well the food came and it was very nice. we paid and went home.

about an hour after i got home, i started to feel slightly off so i decided to lay down for a bit. this went on for about 3 hours so by this point it was about 1am when suddenly i got the urge to go to the loo. as soon as i sat down on the toilet my arse *exploded.* i felt like a faulty hosepipe. at the same time, i needed to be sick. the bath and sink is about 2.5m away so there was no way i could reach and i was in no position to get up whilst i was spraying out shit at all angles. i puked everywhere. it was on my feet, on the walls, all up the side of the toilet, on the door. luckily i had my phone in my pocket, so i messaged my partner for help. i actually felt slightly better, so i got up off the toilet, flushed and went and sat by the bath whilst he cleared up the sick. 

as i was sitting down, i realised i needed to be sick again, so i knelt over the side of the bath and began throwing up again. the force of my retching, unfortunately, caused me to start shitting wildly again.

i was not on the toilet. it was heavy and wet and it stunk. 

so there i was, covered in sick and shit and sweat. i started to peel my clothes off so i could get into the sick-covered bath to shower. just after i got all of my clothes off, i started to retch again. there was no blocking the shit this time. it sprayed on the walls, the sink, the shower, the mirror, everywhere. 

i was naked, covered in my sick from earlier on the toilet, i'd shat myself twice and it was still dribbling down my legs, all dignity lost, whilst my poor fiance was cleaning it up. and all because i didn't have the fucking gammon for dinner.",i shat myself whilst i was naked and it sprayed all over my bathroom.
142,"earlier today i left a pepsi in the freezer to cool off. i felt like drinking it later so i didn't think to move it to the fridge before i went to sleep. i just woke up about an hour ago and was ridiculously warm. i decided i'd go drink that pepsi of mine. the moment i touched it, it instantaneously froze. i didn't think anything would be wrong with it. i walked to the other side of the kitchen from my refrigerator and began to open it.    *boom* it exploded like a grenade of pepsi in my face. it was on the ceiling, in our cupboards and on the floor 10 feet away from me in our living room. i cleaned the stuff that got on the floor and the ceiling. i cleaned the inside of the cupboards that got a taste of pepsi as well.  last but not least, i showered. my hair was stuck together and my eyes were sticky.  not putting pepsi in the freezer again.

i posted this on facebook as well as a small apology to my parents for the mess i made and will finish cleaning in the morning.  ""mom, dad there's a stack of dishes on the counter that got covered in pepsi. if you could load the contents of the sink into the dishwasher i'll wash them tomorrow.""",today i fucked up by opening a frozen pepsi.
143,"it's 4 in the morning and i'm holding a piece of toilet paper to my balls. *why?* you ask? i'll tell ya why. around 3 in the morning, i get this bright idea, ""if i shaved my balls, i wouldn't ever have to deal with it's nuisance again."" and with that, i set off to my bathroom to shave my balls. 

razor? check. scissors? check. soaked balls? check. brother's sink filled with water? chhheeeck. 10 minutes in: everything's going according to plan. the feeling of the blade caressing the skin of my nuts; not a thing to be taken lightly. 

i finally finish everything and decide, ""i'm gonna go over this again,"" because lord knows the only good shaved balls are smooth shaved balls. i then rinse and repeat, but this time, i decide to shave *upward* to make sure i get the little follicles out. this...this is where i fucked up. apparently balls can't handle that, so with each and individual hair that is ripped from my crotch, little splotches of blood appear. of course, myself being in the euphoric state i was in, didn't even notice it. after several seconds of wondering why my water has turned red, i look down, and to my horror...*bloody balls*. i start panicking and grab toilet paper to dab at it. turns out it wasn't too bad, so now as i'm typing this, a piece of toilet paper is the only thing getting between my bloody balls, and my clean pair of underwear. and for those who are probably dying to know, yes. my balls are smooth.","shave down, easy but prickly. shave up, smooth but bloody."
144,"this wasn't too recent so forgive me, but i figure it's embarrassing enough to share. 

so it's 8am and it's the big spanish final i'd been cramming for; i figured i'd do pretty well after all the time i spent studying. so i get there, tired as hell, get seated and wait for the test. there's a delay, so i'm sitting there trying to keep myself from dosing off due to general tiredness during the wait. 

after some time i finally get the test, and the first section is the listening section i'm sure most of you remember. the teacher would read a story aloud and we'd have to answer a multiple choice question about it. this stuff was easy to me, but she would reread each story before moving on, which gave me nothing to do for like 3 minute intervals. 

eventually it's like the 5th question, i'm sick of waiting and i just lay my head down on the desk until the next question. next thing you know i lift my head up all groggy-eyed and look around the room. the teacher isn't standing up reading anymore and everyone is working silently. i look to the clock and realize 30 minutes had passed. i somehow managed to fall asleep and miss the rest of the reading section; not only that, i'd been asleep for 30 minutes and no teacher felt the need to wake me up. 

so i looked down at my test to do damage control and try and make up for what i missed,  when i notice in the corner of my eye a bump. i look down in horror to realize i had massive morning wood from the nap. i was wearing shorts and there was a very visible erection going on down there. i wish it was the pattern in the shorts creating an illusion, but no. 

so i imagine what everyone else saw. they saw a kid sleeping during the exam with an erection. i tried my best to hide it once i realized, but i knew that people saw and i'm pretty sure they weren't going to talk about it (but they would shame me in their minds). in hindsight, maybe they didn't want to wake me up because i had an erection? who knows? all i know was it was embarrassing as hell and i avoided my spanish teacher for the rest of my time at that high school. also yes i miraculously managed to score in the 80s.",fell asleep during an exam and woke up realizing i had a very visible erection that was probably seen by many people. at least i passed. :)
145,"people of tifu, i hit a damn barn.


at work i was pulling an old flat-bed work truck from one of our fleet-customers, out of our shop. it was in for some maintenance work before the plowing season this winter. i backed it out of the garage bay, put it back in drive, started turning to squeeze it between the shop and the barn, and started to accelerate. as far as i could tell, by watching the corner of the barn, and the mirrors, i had enough room to squeeze through. bam. i clipped the corner of the barn with the corner of the flatbed. i backed it up, made enough room, and squeezed back through. i parked the truck, looked at the corner of the barn and the truck, and there was no serious damage to either. i mean, we're talking a steel flatbed, and some corrugated steel and wood. i was really embarrassed, and i was ashamed, so i just worked the rest of the day pretending it never happened. well my boss heard it, and now he doesn't know what to do about it.","; clipped a barn at work, was to embarrassed to tell anyone. boss heard it happen, might fire me."
146,"i'm a student web developer and my boss was put in charge of creating a system to track incoming students for one of the colleges in my university that would enable student recruiters to more effectively reach out to students.

this quickly became exclusively my job, and has become more and more complex as time has gone on. we're talking about a 40-50 page web system with tens of thousands of lines of code behind it. 

unfortunately i have recently had to take two weeks off due to a surgery and the deadline for the system to be finished was during that time. it looks like they went ahead and just scrambled some bits together at the end and started using it.

part of the system is a sub-system to help student recruiters to call students by pulling up the name and number of a student to call who has not yet been called. at some point, this shifted into a system for student recruiters to use to make acceptance calls.

here's the fuck up - i never added a checker to see if the student being called had been accepted.

so tonight the system went live (without anyone else looking at it i suppose) and student workers began calling students and congratulating them on their acceptance.. until:

>hello student a, this is student recruiter b calling from university c  to congratulate you on your acceptance to the college of d!


>uhm, hi student recruiter b, i haven't applied yet but awesome!


>ohshit.jpg

then i got a call from my boss and now i'm waiting to see if he's going to come pick me up to fix it (still recovering from surgery and can't drive)

**","**: anyone with a phone number in a system i built for a college at the university i go to is getting a call tonight congratulating them on their acceptance, accepted or not, because i forgot 6 lines of code."
147,"i'm not trying to outdo any of the other tifu stories here, but this just happened to me five minutes ago.

i don't know about anyone else, but occasionally, i get huge... er.. zits inbetween my legs, not at my crotch, but on my inner thighs. sometimes these things get massive, like to the point that i'm worried i'll have staph.

i know this doesn't seem like it has anything to do with what the title says, but i'll get there. anyway, i'd found one of these on my leg (not hard to do... they hurt like a bitch, so i know when i have one.) and pulled my shorts down to try and pop it. it swole up, huge. so i tried to take my knife to pop that so it would bleed.

after about 5 minutes of this, i realized how it would look if someone were to walk in with me in front of my computer while i had my shorts down, so i quickly stood up and pulled them up, but unbeknownst to me, i had apparently knocked my chair over backwards, and as i tried to sit back down, it looked like a scene straight from the three stooges. i landed on my ass, and my head hit one of the legs on the chair. i was fortunate enough that no one saw me.","tried to pop a crotch zit, became the fourth stooge."
148,"let me just start off my saying i work very hard for any money that comes my way. i babysit up to 6 kids at any time, watching 2 children full time. i am severely underpaid though. i get maybe 20 dollars every few weeks, no matter how often i babysit. (thanks mom) it's incredibly frustrating to try to save up for things, let alone go out anywhere without wanting something. i finally, after many weeks saved up enough to get some clothes i had been dying to get. super excited, i go online and pick out all the clothes i want during this great sale. 70 dollars worth of stuff, holy shiet. 
so exciting. 
i checkout, go through paypal because it's easier, and i don't have my own credit card. autofill thinking whatevs, the name is right, the number is right, city is right, is awl good. 
days pass.
still waiting. 
da fuq. 
i go to the paypal account, everything looks goo-oh my god. wrong address. same city, wrong fucking address. ring up dat ol' paypal. it's obviously too late to change the address, but meh, i'll just call my old apartment complex and let them know what happened. i explain what happened, they say they'll look for it and call me. yay! wrong. it didn't arrive in a box. instead the mailman (i'm assuming) shoved it into some tiny ass mailbox and gave it to whoever lives in that apartment now. i call the place i ordered the clothes from to see if there's anything i can do. no insurance on the package, can't do shit. i hope that whoever lives in that apartment is damn happy having such amazing clothes.","i gifted some random person 70 dollars worth of clothing, which i worked very hard to be able to afford. crying."
149,"so this happened a couple of hours before. we (me and my family) are on a cemetery (in my country we go there if its nov.1). so we are having fun, like joking etc. at the same time, this youngest son of my cousin is very hypertensive, like run here, run there, play here, and play there. at that time there are so many people and it is so easy to loss a kid (especially 3yrs old). then this kid suddenly loss in our sight. his godparent whom his auntie also. run like hell to the direction where she last saw him running. we never thought that he was on the 2nd floor of our mausoleum. then when she returned and ask us if we found him, someone whom behind me says ""no, no, he hasn't found yet"". then the little jerk inside of me suddenly came out without notice. i also yelled the same words with matching pointing out the place where she ran to. then she ask again if he was already found. then i repeated it again. that time i didn't know she wasn't on a very good mood because her favorite nephew whom she was also a godparent is currently mia (i know, i get very insensitive sometimes). then someone behind me said he was there on the upper level. from there it got out of hand and it blows up like a bomb. she yelled that its not a joke if someone is missing and i was in the front and the one whom everyone can blame. then she erupted like a volcano, i never saw her like that. i froze that moment and processing the things i did. she got red and crying out loud and saying things. her brother burst mild laugh then she yelled that he is also to blame and cursed at him. at that time i was sweating like a pig. i feel like i was inside of an oven or even worst i was burning in hell because of i did. then my cousin whom the mother is got mad at her and scolded her because the way she is acting at that moment. because of that i feel even worst. she was scolded because of being to much caring. until now i can't look at her and talk to her. i really feel guilty. :(","we are having fun, tried to made a joke to my cousin that our nephew is still missing, she found out, yelled and crying while scolding us whom literally focused to me, cursed at her brother who laugh mildly. she got scolded by the mother because the way she is acting. and i'm sweating like a pig. and everyone is blaming me."
150,"so i'll start by saying i'm totally straight. me and my dad usually have political arguments. daily actually. well often it gets down to views on human rights. gay marriage. well when it gets down to this i usually flip shit. i admit, i get out of control but he literally says shit like, ""well if we let the gays marry, then people are going to want to marry their car!"" actual dad quote by the way. well anyways today, when i went off, i said, ""if straight people can marry, why can't we?!"" shit got silent there. i tried to correct myself with, ""they,"" but he just said yep and walked away. needless to say he's ignored me for the rest of last night.","tried to defend gays to conservative dad, told him i was gay."
151,"this happened yesterday afternoon. i got up after only about 3 hours of sleep, feeling rather shitty. my wife and brother-in-law were prepping the house for the halloween party we had planned, and i was tasked with making the sweet tea. nothing to difficult, as i'm the designated sweet tea brewer most of the time. i set about making the tea, and my wife tells me to use the glass dispensers we had been gifted for our wedding. 

this is where i made a series of stupid mistakes.

the tea reached boiling point, so i took it off the stove and set it aside to steep for a few minutes. i left the kitchen to go to the bathroom, came back and forgot to pour ice in the dispenser. i also forgot that one of the two dispensers had a fine crack toward the bottom, near the nozzle. 

i poured the hot tea into the cracked dispenser, and heard a resounding crack! thinking i had bounced the pot off the rim, i stopped to check things out. deciding all was well, i filled the remainder of the dispenser with water and finally noticed a small puddle of tea forming around the bottom of the dispenser.

realizing what had happened, i lifted the dispenser to move it into the sink and was soaked from the waist down in hot tea, flooding the counter, stove and floor in the process. the hairline crack near the nozzle had spread all the way around the bottom of the dispenser, so when i tried to move it, the bottom stayed put while the rest of the glass came free in my hands.","i poured hot tea into a giant cracked glass dispenser, broke the bottom off when i tried to move it and flooded my kitchen and soaked my pants in said tea."
152,"earlier today, i was playing pokemon x in my room when my big brother comes in and starts to trash talk my pokemon team. he was just joking, and we got to joke-trash-talking each other.

we started wrestling. well, during the fight, i accidentally kneed him…. really, really hard… right in his… berries. o__o he spent the next fifteen minutes lying on my bed in pain.

being a good little sister, i offered to let him kick me in the cooch or punch my boobs. he said he will… but he's not telling me when. now he keeps faking me out, acting like he's going to kick me and making me flinch. walking around the house is like a survival horror game. i fell down twice trying to avoid his fake vag kicks. it's nuts.","accidentally hit my big bro in his no-nos, and now i live in fear of retaliation. scariest halloween ever."
153,"so basically. it's new years. yay! i went out for the first time. i'm 20 and my folks let me go to my friend's house party which ended up being a total disaster due to someone inviting high school kids. okay so after new years i'm looking for poon meanwhile carefully making sure i don't go near jailbait. i finally found the girl. the house owner who's my best friend really will stick out for me no matter what happens so i said, ""fck it."" or as the kids say, ""yolo."" i talk to this girl downstairs and as it turns out she goes to a university close to mine. she was really cute but i began making up who i was because i didnt want her to know who i am. i said i'm 21 (i look really young, ugh) when i'm actually 20. i told her i'm a third year at this university when i'm a high school fuck up going to community college... and i played it smooth by taking her upstairs to my friend's guest room. by now i was saying i'm his step brother etc.

she began to ask me for id. i refused to give it to her, excuses, more excuses, and ugh. it was bad. so i get on the bed thinking she'd follow my league, she doesnt, i try to nudge to get her to go, and i realized that by now she thinks i'm a lying creep. okay, i probably was acting like one but i was just trying to get it in. anyway, she pulls out her phone and goes downstairs. i knew it was over so i sat in the guest room in remorse.

i made up so much stuff that i even told her my real name. i deactivated my facebook tonight in case she tries to search me up. i have a twitter but no say she'll find me, nor my tumblr, or instagram.

 

i also told my friend (house owner) to never speak of this again. i feel as though i need to hide within the shadows.",i fucked up my first day of 2013 by making some girl think i'm a creep rapist.
154,"so, let's go back in time, back when little ol' me was about six years old. ..

it was near midnight and the house was quiet, save for the pitter-patter of tiny feet in the hallway. i was waddling my way into the bathroom; i think i had too much to drink at dinner, and now my juice had come to pass. 

so i pushed open the door and raised the toilet lid, which wasn't very far in retrospect (there was a towel draped across the tank). and in mid-stream, the inevitable came to pass...

***crash***

for those of you who figured it out earlier: you were correct. the toilet seat fell from it's unstable towel-perch and slammed down on my dick. i don't remember much of what happened later, aside from falling asleep on the way to the hospital to make sure my dick wasn't broken.",a toilet seat smashed my dick when i was six.**

156,"so, i decided it was time to wash the sheets. i have dryer issues so by the time i was ready for bed i was still sheetless. i went downstairs to a closet where i keep a bunch of climbing gear and military gear and pulled an old sheet out of the bottom of the pile of shit that is that closet. yeah, the sheet seemed kind of dirty, but i was too tired to look at it closely. so i get into bed with the sheet over me and decide it's time for my nightly fap. i start noticing a little prickly feeling bout the time i start going for it. i convince myself that it's the sharp ends from the feathers in my bedtopper. those poke me a lot. it also kinda feel like something is crawling on my legs. i kept swatting at them and rubbing them together to make it stop but i continued fapping. maybe it was just pieces of grass that fell off some of my gear into the sheet and was poking me. either way it's uncomfortable so i'll be looking into it after i fap. but i continue fapping. finally i reach the big finish and jump out of bed to clean up. then i grab the sheet and pull it off the bed. in my bed i notice an ant writhing around, obviously wounded by my scratching or leg rubbing. then i notice another and another. then i scratch my ass and realize i'm scratching an ant bite. it's one of several. i picked about 8 ants out of the bed and i'm sure more were still in the sheet. wtf why re ants in a sheet? i don't know. i'll probably be inspecting that closet today.

oh and to make things just a touch worse i was washing the sheets because my parents are coming into town and i wanted them to have a nice bed to sleep in. now they may sleep with ants.

157,"i know its not puking, shitting, or fucking my best friends sister, but damn it, its like someones sister raped me while shitting on my oatmeal.

i just got a job after basically being homeless for a bit, and bumming around living with my girlfriend's parent, i got a job working for an awesome company. they have a 401k program, and trying to be a responsible adult i decide to sign up for it. the first sign up went bad, since not all my data was collected, and i got a call about it, so after 25 tries later, it went through. a solid 1% contribution to a roth ira, with semi-annual increases by 1% topping out at 6%. 50% going to the ira and the rest of that going to stocks/bonds/etc. that was two weeks ago.

as it turns out, that 50% i thought was for the ira was actually 50% of my check. i had an advisor walking me through the process, and he even said that was correct! *""50% is substantially enough for your ira.""* what i understand now is he just jedi mind tricked me into investing way too much. fml, i fucked up. hard.",50% of first paycheck is waiting for me when i retire. i need to go stir my ramen.**

162,"i know this sub has a lot of poop stories, but fuck it, here's one more. also, fuck throwaways.

so i haven't been eating properly for the past few days. you know, lots of fast food, lots of meat and potatoes, not much green vegetables. i usually poop very day, and recently, it's been getting increasingly difficult to get it out. i knew it was because of my eating habits, but for some reason, i didn't change them. i just kept saying ""at least i'm not constipated,"" and continuing on eating junk.

then yesterday happened. i felt the familiar lump in my nethers that means it's time to drop one. i drop trow and get on the turlet. from there, it went something like this:

ok. here it comes... oh, you're a big one, aren't you? that's okay, i'll just give it a little push. hnngg.... hmm. hnnggg! ***hhnnnnggg***
shit.

that's when i realized the folly of my ways. why, oh why didn't i prevent this extreme discomfort? i could have! okay, okay... no use dwelling on it. i need to get through this. i pushed more and harder. there were times when i swear it was moving, but as soon as i would let up on the pressure, this giant basturd would nestle right back in my colon! it was way too late to change my mind about going; the brick was not going back up at all. it was now or never. so i did something i have never done before and will never do again.

i looked around my bathroom. i was in my less used second bathroom, so all that was in there was turlet paper, a hand towel, and a bottle of antibacterial soap. i looked at the soap. desperate times call for desperate measures.

i pumped a bit of soap on my fingers. i worked it around between my fingers and thumb just a little. i reached behind me and felt around a little. i touched my butthole, but i didn't feel any poop. that was weird, because it felt like i had a giant rock hard turd hanging out. so i took a deep breath... and stuck a finger in. my butt was tight, but the soap helped lube it up so i could get in there. almost instantly, i felt the basturd. it felt like a die from a board game, except twice as big. i couldn't believe i was doing this. i was feeling around inside my own butthole for shit.

i tried to wiggle the basturd loose, but it was stuck. so i went a little deeper, past the basturd, and felt even more shit! this shit was more than ready to come out, but the basturd was blocking the way! i had to get it out, but it still wasn't moving, so i stuck my thumb in there too. as of now, i had my index finger and my thumb inside my butt. it was terrible. i worked my thumb around one side of the basturd, and my finger around the other, and tried to wiggle it. it still refused to budge! so i braced myself and pulled. remember how i said it felt like a die? well, as it finally came out, i felt the corners of it popping past my circular rectum, and it dropped into the turlet. it was out! hallelujah! 

as soon as it came out, the rest of the shit train came barreling out behind it. i have never felt so good in my entire life. after i wiped, i tried to look for the basturd to see exactly what it looked like, and maybe take a picture, but it was gone. from that day forth, i have swore to never allow that to happen to me ever again! i will eat green vegetables every day, and even take colace capsules! my fingers still smell like poop, no matter how much i wash them.","allowed myself to become terribly constipated. ended up lubing my fingers up with soap, sticking them up my butt, and pulling the shit out. never again."

shortly after, i got awful stomach pains after i finished the jug and proceeded to throw up.

i love sunny d soo much, that two or three weeks later i bought some more at the store, thinking the last time i drank it and got sick was from something unrelated, and proceeded it drink it all in the same day again. after everybody had went to sleep and i was laying in bed, the same awful stomach pains returned and i proceeded to violently throw up on the floor and my bed.

164,"i had just moved house to a lovely close knit neighbourhood and naturally had about a million boxes of crap to sort through. this morning i woke up, threw on my fluffy pink dressing gown and continued like i had done for the past few days, just sorting through junk from my old house. in one of the boxes though i stumbled across my darth vadar rollerblades i had as a kid. i’m a girl and they were given to me by my older brother but i didn’t care, it felt like i spent my entire childhood whizzing along down the streets at top speeds of 5mph, grazing my knees and flying into bushes. i got incredibly nostalgic and naturally i excitedly tried them on right then and there. they were a bit of a tight fit but they were adjustable so i managed to get to them on. i haven’t got any carpet laid down yet so there i was skating around my house going on a little nostalgia trip. it was magical. after about 10 minutes i figured i should take them off but why not just keep them on? i was certainly able to move things around quicker from room to room, plus it was pretty fun. i ended up 2 hours later sat in front of the tv with some alphabetti spaghetti, too lazy to bother taking the skates off… when i heard a knock at the back door.

now here’s where i should mention how my house is laid out. i was in the lounge sat in the armchair with my back to the window. my house kind of curves around and so if someone is at the backdoor, they would be standing right next to that window. in my old neighbourhood i wasn’t used to people walking around to the back door unless they were friends. but this was a whole different place where people not only come round the back but walk into your house uninvited too as i had learned the few days previous when i nearly assaulted my poor elderly (albeit trespassing) neighbour who informed me that it’s just what people do here?! so here is where i am fucked. someone is at my back door (which is open – inviting to these friendly trespassing neighbours) and here i am – a woman in her mid 20's sat in a furry dressing gown at midday eating alphabetti spaghetti with darth vadar rollerblades on. the person can see through the window, they can see my head, they know i’m home. i can’t ignore them. it’s only a matter of time before they simply walk through the door and my bizarre recently adopted childish habits are revealed. 

ok, what are my options? i’m running out of time. i have to act fast. i looked down at my skates - both double tied with velcro and 4 straps. god damn these things would take way too long to remove. i had to consider my other options at this point.

plan a. i can pretend to be a statue. if i stay really still they might think i’m a mannequin or something. but then if they come in they will see a woman in her mid 20's not only wearing rollerblades but also pretending to be a statue. 

plan b? i can pretend to be deaf. could work although i’d have to pretend to be deaf until i moved house which would require an awful lot of effort where i’d have to learn sign language to keep up appearances. i’m too lazy. next. 

plan c. man up? just man the fuck up, put down my plate of alphabetti spaghetti and skate over to that back door like i don’t give a fuck. could work. they might think i’m kooky and eccentric. it could become a humourus story among the neighbours about how carefree and hilarious i am. i could become elevated to high status within the community and all the old people would love me and bring me baked goods and i’d never have to buy an oven. or more likely they think i’m totally fucking weird and i become the outcast of the street and nobody would agree to take in my endless amazon orders while i’m out. 

as i’m scanning through increasingly bizarre solutions in my head i realise i’ve wasted too much time. “hello?” i hear a man say… from the kitchen. yes, the man has walked into the house and is now literally a few feet away from my feet. my plastic red and black wheel covered feet. so which option should i go for? a, b or c? i surprised myself and ended up going for a plan i didn’t know existed until i chose it. plan d. get up as fast as you can and skate the fuck out of there before he sees. i don’t know what stupid brain cell made me choose that option. as if i could fucking discreetly skate out of a room in which the man was now in the doorway, watching as a pink ball of fluff slams her skates across her hardwood floor to the other door into the next room in a desperate attempt to escape humiliation. there was no turning back now. he had seen. he had heard. he knew my secret and he knew i had tried to hide it from him. i couldn’t go back and face him now. it’s too late. it was over. i skated to the corner of the room and hid behind a box in vain hope he wouldn’t follow me in. he didn’t. instead he said “uhm… just wanted to welcome you to the neighbourhood…let me know if you need anything…” and left. and to add insult to injury, as i sat there among the boxes, deep with burning shame in my darth vadar life destroyers, he walked past the window and looked in and saw me. so... what am i gonna do about my amazon orders now?","found some old darth vadar roller skates, wore them, neighbour caught me roller skating away from him in deep shame."
165,"it's friday evening and i'm stuck in school in drama boosters. having finished my work i was re-reading some attack on titan manga while everyone got on with their work. since we were working in a different room that was adjacent to our normal room, you could just about see that the lights were on. my teacher questioned this, and me being the helpful guy i am told her i'd go and turn it off. i walk in without checking and right there in the middle of the room is my friend who was right in the middle of kissing his girlfriend. they freeze, i freeze. me being the socially awkward person i am, i mumble something about the lights and switch them off, leaving them in total darkness, then nope'd the fuck out of there, cheeks ablaze

what makes it worse is that they're both really good friends of mine and are in the  majority of my classes, to add insult to injury i came in later when his girlfriend had left to apologise but the words didn't seem to form.

167,"it's still thanksgiving in the us.

but now i've woken up from something shameful. i'm studying abroad, and yesterday (thanksgiving) our abroad group had no classes and a group potluck feast. i got up bright and early to start preparing, also started drinking. long story short, i passed out two hours before the feast and woke up two and a half hours after it started. i sat up in bed shouting ""shit, shit, shit,"" fretted for a few minutes, resolved to go anyway. i managed to cook half of the green beans before i passed out, so i brought them, and a bottle of sake too. i was still drunk and everyone could tell. i sat in the corner pigging out, ashamed of myself, consoled by my drunk friends and by the free beer.","drank too early, too quickly, arrived two and a half hours late to school sponsored thanksgiving, sauced and sour, with half a tray of green beans and a bottle of sake."
168,"it's a bit of a long story, but bear with me. 

this thanksgiving, after my sister's persuasion, i decided to go to her family's house, since everyone else was going to be going there. i would be there all week, and i didn't want to leave my pet hamster, buddy, alone for the holidays, so i brought him with me all the way up to chilly montana. 

my sister's daughter (who is three) absolutely feel in love with buddy. she'd play with him, feed him, and hug him. she'd even asked me to bring his cage into her room, which i agreed so long as she never took him out unless there was an adult to watch. 

now, a few hours ago, she was put to bed while the rest of the family would be out in the family room, enjoying the later hours of this day of feasting. her room always got cold, and when the girl woke up to use the restroom, she looked over to see my hamster shivering. 

like any three year old with an astute concern for life, she decided it would be a good idea to warm buddy up by throwing him in the microwave. now this would be breaking the one rule i gave her, but she would see it as saving the poor hamster from the freezing temperatures of the house. 

so here i am, in the family room, far from the kitchen, when i hear a ***pop*** followed by a scream. 

the hamster exploded within 42 seconds of putting him in there.

his blood, gore, and fur lined the window, with the bones jutting into the plastic frame of the microwave. 

i've spent to past few hours cleaning up his remains. 

my friends, never trust a young kid with your pets.

169,"so today i decided for the first time to try to shave my pubic hair. i hadn't shaved it before, so the hairs were quite long. i tried going for it with the razor, but it wasn't working too well because the long hairs would get stuck in the blade. i decided to get some scissors and trim down the hairs first.

when i trimmed them, i would pull them taught to avoid cutting myself.  all was going well until i decided to get to the hairs on my scrotum. after a few snips i suddenly felt a stinging pain in my ballsack. when i first looked down i didn't see blood, so i thought i was okay. i pulled away the hairs to dispose of them and attached to one i saw a little piece of flesh stuck onto the end.

i looked down and then saw that i had started bleeding. it took about 10 minutes to get the bleeding to stop, but i'm okay now. it wasn't too deep, it was just really painful, as well as terrifying knowing that i had just cut off some of my scrotum.",i was trimming my pubic hair and accidentally cut off a small piece of my scrotum.
170,"okay to preface, this actually happened a little bit ago, but nonetheless is a great account of the accidents that happen when you work in a warehouse. 

so, one day at work i was lugging around my scanner, they are these fat ancient things called geminis. they are overly bulky, probably weighing a bit over a pound. i have to walk with this thing in my arms for 10-12 hours a day, so at times, you will drop your scanner, your elbow will cramp up, or something else that happens when you do repetitive motion with a light weighted object.

well one day while working i had to load some product into a tote to go off to shipping. normal daily stuff for a picker. so i dropped what must have been 20 pounds of books into the tote with the scanner in my hand. when i did this my arm recoiled back up and into my face. i saw fucking black spots for a second like what normally happens when you hit your nose...but i didn't just hit my nose. i hit my lip.

i get that taste of blood in my mouth, the special one that only happens when you get teeth drilled or you fuck your mouth up bad. i take my hand and press it to my lips when i pull my hand back i look at my glove, and yep...there's a shit ton of blood. i take my glove off as to not alert hr to my tremendous idocy, i tuck in my bottom lip, i walk to the bathroom after unloading tote, look into the mirror, and find a pool of blood dripping out my mouth. 

i kept blotting my face, like it would help, i managed to get it cleaned up enough to see my bottom lip went straight into my teeth. a split line remained. i hide in stall, manage to get the bleeding down to a reasonable level and head off to lunch. i show my best friend who worked there and two words came out of his mouth ""dumb ass"". i decided to walk off with my tail between my legs, ask for the second half of the day off from hr, they gave it to me, i didn't give a reason. i now have a permanent scar of the line of my teeth on my bottom lip.",i used to be a picker like you until i took a gemini to the face.
171,"so yesterday, i had an essay due for my english class. naturally, i worked on it the morning it was due, emailed the progress to myself and decided to finish it during my class break. so during my class break i head to the computer lab and i'm all inspired to write, i polish my final draft, it's a beautiful analysis of carls jr commercials, works cited is actually completed and done perfectly in mla format. it's the best thing i've ever written, the conclusion is brilliant, i'm so proud of it. 

so it's about 5 minutes before my class starts, i hit ctrl+s about 5 times like a paranoid parrot, and i close the word document file thinking it's gotta be saved somewhere. so my plan is to email it to myself, so i can quickly go and add money to print card, then come back and print it.

well, as soon as i close it i get a bad feeling. i try to do the attachment and i can't find it. i go through every folder frantically searching for my masterpiece. nothing. i open up word to see if i can pull up some ""recent"" files. empty.

i panic, go over to the help desk almost in tears and the guy isn't able to help me out. i end up spending my english class time re-writing it from the draft i emailed myself that morning, but it just wasn't the same....

to top it off, when i got to my car that evening, i realized that my usb drive (to which i saved my second final draft to and to which my keys are attached to) was somewhere in the computer lab. luckily, when i went back 3 hours later, they were still stuck in the computer.","didn't properly save a masterpiece, re-wrote it as shit."

so today. the next magic trick to get rid of the little buggers was to very carefully, and very stupidly, pour half a bottle of cayenne pepper into a hot bath. no big deal, right? wrong.

i don't know what i was expecting.. but the words ""most people who use it place large amounts of cayenne into a hot bath, remaining there until the water is cold."" were a little misleading.

i need to go pour 5 gallons of milk into my bath tub and hope that it can stop the burning before i eat some ghost peppers to cool down.","tried every remedy for scabies, thought a cayenne pepper bath would kill them off, basically lit my entire body on fire trying to ""soak"" in the bath."

i sneek into her house anyways and we enjoy some alone time for the first time in 2 months. we're good, we're cuddling and the garage door opens.

scrabble to get on clothes success. but no time to get down stairs. fuck.

so now i'm hidding in her closet behind her clothes till her mom: a goes to the store, b walks the dog, or c parents dad and brother come home and fall asleep around 10.

help? 

(ignore the grammar/spelling/punctuation i'm on my phone and fingers are still twitchy with adrenaline.)

update 1: her kindle chargers long enough to reach my phone so that's a plus but i have to take a mad post sex piss.

update 2: yay her dad and brother are back too... at least her dog's not giving me up


update. 3 go a head and fuck me. her dad came into.her room into the corner with the closet and looked around he's suspicious and came literally within inches of finding me. chaining me up in the basement. and fucking me with a splintery piece of wood. i want to.come clean and be honest but i think it's too late for that.

update: 4 have a bottle to piss in and move the shoe from under me without banging into the wall. that's better. 2 more hours and i should be safe.

5: filled that bottle to the top and feel a lot better

update 6 it's all over she found me told me to get out of her house wouldn't say anything else to.me just to leave. idk what happens next. sorry guys. 

update 7: first off i realize how ridiculous it sounds for a guy in college to hide from his girlfriends parents. her parents vary much want to believe their daughter is a darling pure angel. and she is but she's not 7 years old any more... they haven't accepted that so i wont be allowed to see her for a while.

also at first we were really banking on the fact that her mom would step away and i'd get out before her dad/brother got home like i was never there and avoid the whole thing. but that didn't happen and it was to late so siting there waiting seemed to be the best answer because if i had come clean we'd be in the same situation.

she's not responding to me but her mom texted me essentially that we fucked up, lost her trust, and i can't see her for a while. again with most parents we wouldn't be in this situation. her parents are not the average parents.

i'll update again when i hear from her again...

** 


update 8: alright guys so gf got back in touch with me and turns out her nosy neighbor saw me walk into the house, knew her parents were out, and called her mom. seriously i know this sounds like i'm dating a child but that's what happened. that's her mom and neighbor for you. 

so her mom knows i'm in the house, drives home and asks my gf if i was there. she of course lied which we now know was the wrong thing to do. coming clean right then would have still fucked us over but at least we wouldn't have lied about it. problem is we didn't know she knew and were hoping she'd be gone in 10 minutes then i could leave. this has happened once before and her mom got what she came for then left. i got out of the house asap with out a problem last time and we hung out the next day.

if this story didn't have any bat shit crazy in it i wouldn't have posted it. i'm going over tomorrow to apologize in person, come clean, and try to retain what ever man i have left in me.

**also this is today i fucked up not today i had foresight. i fucked up.**

update 9 i'm going to bed i'll probably be back tomorrow.

alright guys another update/clarification. my gf is 18 but hasn't been for long, she's graduating from high school in a couple months. so that helps explain the situation.


last update for a while from a comment reply that's probably buried at the bottom of this:

"" sorry so basically her mom's mad at me and i'm not allowed over for a while. i'm 300 miles away anyways so it's really not a huge deal and will probably blow over before my last exam.

i went over to her house saturday to apologize to the mom (both our families were busy thursday/friday) but she wouldn't open the door or speak to me so that was that.

i sent a letter in the mail should come any day...

hopefully time will heal this and they will realize their daughter isn't a child any more and what we did really isn't surprising. it's damn near expected i'd go see there daughter when ever i got the chance.

ohh also she doesn't think we were doing anything sexual. ""we were just spending as much time as we could before i left since we both had lots of other things to do over break"".

so she's not even mad about the sex just that i was there. if i had come out when she came home i'd have my dignity but we'd be in the exact same situation. i'd just still be a man.""",- i'm beta as fuck when it comes to her parents**
179,"okay, this actually happened quite a few years ago, but since i didn't know about tifu back then, i figured i could tell it now.

quick backstory, i have had ibs for most of my life.  i have had more emergency stops at fast food restaurants, truck stops, and convenience stores than i count.  mercifully, i've only shit my pants a few times, but this one time i'm about to recount was a fucking doozy.

a friend of my husband's had an oktoberfest party, which meant a lot of greasy sausages, potato salad, homebrew beer, and food that my gi tract generally treats with extreme prejudice.  i try to stay away from shit like that, but it was a party and the food was good, so i ate.  i ate a lot. 

now, at times like this, i forget that i have ibs and go about my business not thinking of the possible consequences.  so, as the dd (i wasn't drinking that night), i get in the truck, throw my sloppy drunk, half-conscious husband in the passenger seat, and get headed home.

i get lost.  and end up in the busy bar district of a big city on a saturday night.  and then the cramps hit.  the evil, horrible, cramps that hurt more than childbirth.  i try to rouse my husband, and he mumbles something about parking and going into a bar and slips back into his coma.  i wanted to kill him in his blissful drunkard's sleep.  i felt like i was giving birth to a bowling ball out of my asshole, and he was snoring contentedly in the passenger seat, offering no help at all.

there is no parking (it's packed) anywhere. any bar is going to have a bathroom line.  the last thing i want to do is shit all over myself while waiting in line for an hour.  there's no fast food or convenience stores for miles around.  i decide to high tail it out of the city and try to make it home.   or to a gas station outside of the city.  anywhere.

then we hit traffic.  at this point, i'm crying from the pain, trying desperately to hold in the torrent of shit that wants to explode out of my ass, and screaming because traffic. is. stopped.  for miles.

after an excruciating half hour, i see an exit ahead.  sweet freedom!  there has to be gas station nearby.  as i start to feel relief, i am assaulted by another round of cramps, and this time, the shit will not be contained.  the hot burning shit from hell begins to exit my anus at an alarming rate.  i have just shit my pants and am stuck sitting in it.

mind you, i am still trying to drive while all this happens.

i get off at the exit, and pull over to the side of the road (which is deserted) as fast as i can.  i look in the back seat and strike gold.   i have an entire box of diapers in the car.  i thank god for having a small child.  i figure i can divest myself of my soiled clothing, wipe up the seat, and line my ass with diapers until i can get to a bathroom.  i can throw the dirty clothes and diapers in the bed of the truck and be done with it.  perfect.  so i get out of the truck with about 20 diapers and head off into the brush by the side of the road for privacy.

at the same time, my husband awakes from his coma to puke all over the side of the road and on the truck.

and that's when i see and hear the red and blue lights.  fuck.  i'm crouched in the bushes, my shit-filled pants are completely off, i've discarded my ruined underwear into a pile of diapers, and i'm trying to wipe as much of the poop as i can off of my legs, ass, and ladyparts with a wad of diapers.

the cop stops behind the truck.  i'm watching all this from the side of the road, and he doesn't see me.  he came up to the truck, got a whiff, and i swear he stepped back about 5 feet.  

""what's going on?"" he says to my husband.

drunky mcdrunk responds, almost unintelligibly, ""my wife is back there... (points to the brush) ...she's sick.  i'm drunk.  you know where a gas station is?""

cop thinks about the situation, seems to make up his mind, and says, ""half a mile that way, there's a gas station that's open.""

he practically runs to his squad car and hauls ass to get away.

i stumble back to the car, forego the gas station, and drive home with no pants, covered in shit and diapers.  

i was shocked that the cop didn't find me and give me a breathalyzer since my obviously drunk husband said i was ""sick,"" but my feeling is that the combined odor of booze, puke, and nuclear oktoberfest grease bomb shit threatened to make him puke, so he just got the fuck out of there instead of deal with whatever weird predicament he stumbled upon.

i can see the headlines now... ""soiled woman wearing diapers arrested for possible dui.""","shit myself in car, pull over on the side of the road and plaster myself in diapers, cop pulls up and decides this is too weird for him, runs away."

he says that he is going to leave soon and that she needs to start packing up to head home. (it was true, but he said it in a very weird way) she's laying on the couch staring and me and i'm staring at her. she was so embarrassed. i walk her to her car and tell i'm sorry and that we'll make it through this and stuff. as soon as i walk back into my house my dad is right there and talks about how she isn't allowed upstairs at all and how the room will have all of the lights on and no blanket will be covering her. he says he is dissapointed in me and i'm certain he doesn't respect me or her as much anymore. she calls her best friend (my best friend's gf) crying and now i'm trying to talk to her and tell her it's o.k. tifu","made out/felt up girlfriend, dad walked in, dad is pissed, privileges stripped, girlfriend is embarrassed and crying."

**update** got to class, sat down a bit nervously but much to my surprise a second later she sat next to me again. after a bit of silence, we start talking about 4chan, random class happenings, and the campus of which i took as the opportunity to apologize for the last class and ask if i could buy her coffee to make up for it. plus i added in so that we could talk more since i couldnt stay around after class. with out hesitation she said yes. was actually caught off guard, in a good way this time, by how smoothly it went. thankyou marblednightmare, bearbak, shdfkhskfefe, and everyone else for the advice!","hot girl approached, didn’t know if real life, just read exact scenario on 4chan and ended up pretty much reenacting it"
184,"dear redditors,

the events that transpired took place on sunday morning but it has taken me this long to deal with the repercussions of said fuck ups.  today i break the norm and put the tl;dr first.

 

i struggle with how to tell about how the events transpired.  should i post my original tifu which is scrawled on the tear stained inside cover of the book that i was reading in the airport when i decided i should post this in tifu?  i promise you dear redditors that know matter how i tell this it will be worth the read. i consider this punishment for my many many poor choices.  i will hold nothing back and tell you every sordid detail.  i should ask is there interest in hearing how this all unfolded?  

edit:
saturday night after a beautiful out door wedding ceremony we took the party bus to dinner where i consumed two #9's.  i don't know what's in them but they were but they were pretty strong.  after dinner we went back to the hotel to change into bar hopping attire where we met up with the wedding party and had shots.  from there we bar hopped along bourbon street.  around 3am i noticed my friend had disappeared so i figured i needed to kill a couple of more hours so my friend could have some privacy... 

i left the beach (fuck up number 1 ditching friends) and started heading toward canal st.  i'm feeling great smiling at people loving the party atmosphere.  when this woman sidles up to me and starts chatting me up.  i'm like neat, two nights in a row a woman has chatted me up.  (i read the game and follow seddit and i'm thinking this shit is really working).  so she asks me if i want to grab a drink.  i let her know that i don't buy drinks for woman its against policy.  she's like its cool she can buy her own drinks.  (this makes me think its legit.)  so we have a couple of drinks and she's like there is a more private less loud bar around the corner where we can hear each other a bit better.  as soon as we starting heading away from bourbon street (fuck up number 2) alarms start going off in my head (ignoring alarm bells fuck up #3).  so i look at her and ask ""are you going to kill me?""  she starts laughing and puts me at ease.  we head on.  at the back space bar we have a couple of more drinks (this time i broke my rule and paid....).  we are having a great conversation and i'm killing time so win win.  she says we should go to another bar where it where its a little more private.  

so we move up the street the harem (fuck up #4 - yes these are the real names) and i think it says harlem because i asked her about it.  any way this joint looks shady as hell.  she's says it's fine and she starts having a conversation with the bar tender and i walk over and she tells me to go sit and she'll be over in a minute (i'm thinking this is strange but i'm wierdly disconnected from everything going on at this point - fuck up #5).  there is this really fit woman wearing something lacy with a weird white eye at the end of the bar and i'm thinking she looks scary and manish at the same.  any way she comes back over and we have a couple of more drinks.  she says she's horny and she wants to fool around (i'm like sweet i'm going to score two nights in a row and have to fr's for seddit i'm the fucking man).  she then says we can't go back to her hotel because her family is staying there and i'm like well bummer and good night because i got my friend sacked out in the room.  she says we can go and hook up in the hotel bath room (i'm not sure why this sounded like a good idea to me at the time (fuck up #???shit i lost count). so we head back to the hotel.  then she says we can't do it in the lobby bathroom we need to hit the bathroom in our room. edit:
i'm pretty hesitant about this but she cajoles me into going (fuck up).  my friends in the room passed out so we get in the bathroom and she  says we should both wipe off since we been out and about for a bit.  this sounds reasonable.  so she wipes herself off and then wipes me off and starts blowing me (i'm standing in front of the door). its ok but not the best i've ever had. she says she wants to fuck now and get a condom.  i grab the condom and put it on and she flicks the light off (fuck up) and bends over the counter and hikes her skirt up.  the worst most rancid smell hits my nose, its like a fucking rotting corpse its so bad.  my dick starts withering. i'm flashing to a scene in trainspotting or the follow up porno where spud is fucking this drunk chick who had a dried turd in her panties and then i'm thinking how am i going to extricate myself from this situation when she grabs my junk and shoves it in.  i can't keep it up and she's asking me if her pussy aint good enough so i go to flick on the lights and she flicks them back off and spins be around and sits me on the toilet.  she pulls the condom off and starts blowing me again.  she asks if i have another condom and i don't.  she says she going to run to the vending machine and grab another condom and she'll be right back.  out she goes (fuck up). i'm sitting on the can reflecting on all this mighty relieved she's gone and it will be easier to extricate myself now that she isn't in the room.  so i'm sitting there thinking about how fucked up this has been.  i must have sat there for two minutes or when i get up and get dressed.  i'm like wait something is wrong here.  my pants aren't the right weight.  so i search my pockets and no galaxy g4.  fuck where the hell is my phone.  i search the bathroom, it isn't there.  fuck she stole my fucking phone.  

i run down stairs.  way too late. she's long gone.  so i head straight to the lobby to use the phone and call the phone company to have my phone disabled.  once that's done i head to the business center to change all the passwords linked to the products on my phone.  i hit the bank up first.  as soon as i log in i see two withdrawals within the last 10 minutes totaling $600 (my daily limit).  i call the bank and then call the police.

edit: 

the police show up while i'm still in the business center resetting passwords.  of course they send two female officers and i'm like fuck now i got to tell these two woman what an asshole i am.  so i tell them the story.  i am completely honest about it and leave nothing out. then they accuse me of hiring a prostitute.  i'm completely flabbergasted.  i did not offer any money nor did she ask for any money.  then they ask me it was a man.  i said no but then she asked about the penetration again and when i said it was from behind they were like it was probably a dude.  now i'm totally disgusted, demoralized and shamed.  the one officer said my wife should divorce me and i'm like i'm already fucking divorced and wtf i'm the victim here.  she continued to berate me.  telling me she can't believe i did that when my friend was in the room and i totally put them at risk and on an on for like 10 minutes.  admittedly i deserve it but at the time it was just too soon.  she then reiterated that it was probably a dude because i never saw her vjj and did it from behind.  totally demoralized.  so all in all she* stole my phone, $600 , my dignity, pride, self respect and a piece of my soul.","got wasted in new orleans, picked up by a woman who the police say was probably a hooker oh and, by the way, might also have been a man (fucking gross- no offense to those that swing that way just my own preference) and then got robbed for my trouble."
185,"so i was very drunk at 3am in town whilst out with some friends.  i decided to rip a piece of foam from some scaffolding in the street (was going to use it as some kind of foam sword). the a police officer shouts at me and in my drunken state i thought i was in serious trouble so i ran. i looked behind me and the officer was way back so i was like ""fuck yeah!"" then i turn back and see a bright fluorescent arm come from no where and i'm laid out on the floor.   i got clothes lined by another police officer. hard. they said i was an idiot and to go home.","- ran from the police for no reason, got clothes lined."
186,"i was at a party out at a friend's house. decent sized event; bonfire, beer pong, barbecue, heavy drinking; the type of thing i'd typically avoid like the plague but a buddy of mine and his girlfriend really want to go so i do. 

i only knew the friend and the couple that i rode with, and i'm designated driver, so naturally i'm bored as shit and not talking to anyone. i begin to pretty much chain-smoke, as i am wont to do in situations of extreme boredom the male of the couple has had a couple of mixed drinks so he's a wee bit toasted and we get to chitty chatting. 

i pull out another cigarette to light. he asks for one, which i obligingly give to him. he then gets a brilliant idea. he dares me to try and light my cigarette in the campfire. remember at this point, that i am completely sober and my friend is the drunk one.

i figure it'll add some excitement to this party if i give it a shot, so i pop the cigarette into my mouth and begin to bend over the fire. i lean in closer and closer inching my way towards it, until at the last second i remember that my hair is longer than i usually keep it. i flinch back and pull my hair back and begin to lean in once more.

as i finally get close enough to the fire to light my cigarette, a plume of fire bursts up and catches me right in the face. out of panic, i let go of my hair which drops into the fire and catches along with my now burnt eyebrows and eyelashes. i stand straight up realizing i'm on fire. all those years of schools teaching you ""stop, drop and roll"" are nice, but they don't really do shit for you when you're actually on fire.

i take off running, thinking maybe if i run fast enough it'll blow the fire out... it doesn't. i finally catch eye of a small kiddie pool that my friend has set up and throw myself into it face first. the fire is now out. worst part of all, my face caught but my cigarette didn't so i didn't even succeed in the dare. we left the party shortly thereafter",i lit my face on fire trying to light a cigarette in a campfire and put it out in a kiddy pool.
187,"from last friday, but whatever: i was out walking along the cliffs near my college campus with a friend of mine, and he broke out this very small pipe (maybe three inches) to smoke some weed.  i don't smoke often, but i had nothing to do, so i took a few hits.

the damn pipe shot ash in your mouth every time you took a hit, so i backed off of it after i realized it wasn't just a fluke.  we got back to the college town where i live and it was about 10 pm.  as we're walking to my friend's house on the main party street, i notice a girl walking alone a little ways ahead of us.  i mention to my friend how sometimes seeing girls alone in this town at night makes me a little worried that something might happen to them.  i was high, and just then i remembered that my tongue tasted ashy still, so i set about fixing that.  the girl had heard what i said, as my high estimate of the distance between us was quite poorly done, and thinking about it now, she was probably fifteen feet ahead.  she uncomfortably turned around and looked at me, and just then, i stuck my tongue out as far as i could and used my fingers to scrape the ash off of it.  didn't seem that weird to me at the time, but then i put the pieces together the next day when i was sober.

how i imagine it from her perspective:

walking home alone one night when some creepy guy makes some comment about how girls walking alone should be careful...*something might happen*.  checked to see wtf that was about and the creep has his tongue out and is rubbing it.  sped up quite a bit at that point.","said that *things* could happen to girls walking alone well within earshot of a girl.  she turned to look at me and she saw me, tongue out, with my fingers all over it."
188,"i just got home from work, and decided to wash my cares away with a hot, cleansing shower. i felt inclined to listen to music while i showered, but of course i didn't realize this until i had already completely disrobed. alas! my laptop was in the kitchen, and it contained all my tunes. since my roommates were still at school, i nipped out of my bathroom to get my laptop from the kitchen table. as i bent down to get it, i heard infantile screams echo across my apartment complex. ""she's naked oh my godddd!!!"" screamed the gaggle of junior high-aged kids outside my open kitchen window blinds. i froze, picked up my computer, and bolted back into my dark and draped bedroom.",forgot kitchen blinds were open while reveling in my post-work nudity**
189,"here i was, minding my own business, watching the filthiest dirtiest smut i could find, because i'm just classy like that, and i really got more than i bargained for.

it starts off so innocently, as it always does. me sitting here nude, contemplating my next honorable maiden, sifting through the garbage to find my golden angel.

and there she was, right there in front of me, shrieking like a banshee in heat, crying and begging for my thick cock. the internet truly is for porn.

so i'm going at it, edging like a madman, horny as hell, not even remembering the last time i spilled my spunk. almost two hours go by, and the time for spillage is near. now, i'm not one to boast, my average sized dick is average as you can imagine, but when the stars align properly, and the gods grant me favor, i can give peter north a run for his money.

so here i am, leaning back as far as i can in my chair, deciding to lay a napkin on my stomach and commence spillage onto it. nope.

spunk shot initiated, chambers are open, brace yourselves men, this is a one way trip from crotchville... aaaaand *liftoff* mach 3 reached, sound barrier breached, **boom** headshot.

dodging the napkin before me, i'm simultaniously caught off guard and forced to watch in slow motion, scumbag brain leaving my mouth agape in horror, as the spunkshot of the gods breaks the sound bearier and overshoots the target, landing straight down my face, making sure to not only splatter into my eyes, but also grace my stupidly open mouth, and work it's way up into a splatter of messy, sticky hair and beyond.

and this was just round one. the battle was lost, yes, but the war is still raging hard. out spurts round two, only this time the initial shock of facialing myself caused me to lose grip of my ever vigilant man meat, which is now allowed to roam freely as my second blast shoots clear over my head and onto the wall behind me, and possibly on my rug, and i have to do something quickly to stop it, my stupid self thinks, so i hastily prevent it from further making a mess *by pointing it back down again*, which only proves to further destroy my vision as i blast one right into my eye, and another on my neck. but no, the fun doesn't stop here. with bravado that would impress even the energizer bunny, it keeps going and going and going, for nearly a dozen rapid fire bursts that make me realize that female and homosexual porn stars *really* couldn't get paid enough for what they put themselves through. it was a disaster zone, and my only consolation was that my barely scathed napkin was unharmed in the making of this mess, and was readily available to spit this fucking cum out of my mouth, and out of my eyes, and out of my hair, and off of my face, and off of the floor, and the wall, and my stomach, and the rug, and i'm starting to think a cumbox might be a good idea at this point.

190,"i studied my ass off for a test 2 weeks prior, and the day finally came..except that i didn't bring myself a pen and highlighter. i had the materials for the multiple choice but not for the essay that sooner came with it. unfortunately my teacher is one of those people who will chew you out for forgetting your stuff, and basically said i'd have to sacrifice the time i had left (once i'm finished) to attempt to get my pen and highlighter. i ended up having to bs 2 pages worth of multiple choice questions just to have time for to get the materials for an essay i struggled with and probably didn't even do superior on.

embarrassing part? i even forgot to use my highlighter for the essay...",purposely bombed a test i studied the most for because of forgetting a pen and highlighter.
191,"it was a half day at my school today. i woke up as normal, at 6:30 in the morning. ereyesterday, i had pulled an all nighter, and yesterday, i fell asleep at 2 am. i was pretty tired, but i could deal with it. i was going to just take a nap for a few hours, it was 6:30 in the morning, and i didn't have school until 11:30 am. 

i crawl into bed, and, knowing myself, i wake up every few hours to readjust. i would set my watch to beep, but i felt that, for sure, i would have woken up. on days like this, my parents call me to make sure i don't sleep through it, anyway. i close my eyes and fall sleep very quickly.

i wake up, and after moving around a bit and unswaddling myself from the blankets, i suddenly notice that it is dark. ""oh fuck, what time is it?"" i fumble with the button on my watch that activates the backlight. i finally press it. 

""6:45""

oh. my. god.

i start freaking out, trying to make it look like i went to school so i won't get in trouble. i throw my backpack in the kitchen, and my shoes next to it. before i can get in the shower, my mom comes home.

""what the fuck, canobiecrazy, are you *trying* to flunk out of school? you know that this was your 7th time."" 

then i realize, staring dumbstruck at my mom, that this *was* my 7th absence. i'm going to fail all of my classes because of it, unless i can get some excused. i'm really upset at myself right now. i stay home a lot, because i get bad anxiety, and some days i just can't make it into school. also, because i have sleep problems, and when you haven't slept in 48+ hours, you don't get much work done in school. i don't have doctors notes for that kind of absence, even though they make up all the other 6, due to their nature. 

i don't know what to do at this point. i'm going to talk to my guidance counselor, because i don't even see a therapist or doctor about this anymore(that's another story :/)",failed all of my classes 1st quarter of senior year because i didn't wake up from a nap.
192,"i'm a us navy sailor, which means i wear a uniform at work. this uniform has a hat (spoken ""cover"") associated with it, which i am not normally allowed to wear inside. the normal way to keep your cover with you for this uniform is to put it in a cargo pocket at your knee; my current supervisor (who i will just call chief) doesn't like that method. chief prefers that we tuck the brim of the cover into the back of our waistband.

i had just shown up for work. there was a little abdominal grumbling, but nothing, i thought, that couldn't wait. we gathered in ranks, then our superiors started to give out information.

>""we will be taking the watch with conditions as follows...""

>""there is maintenance ongoing at the following locations...""

>""we had an issue with procedural compliance yesterday...""

>""safety is paramount...""

>""in a few minutes the lieutenant will be here to talk to you about...""

>""all of us must remain accountable...""

this went on for some time; chief had mustered us early to put out some extra information. the abdominal grumbling was getting worse; once chief dismissed us, there would definitely be some urgent travel to the head.

thirty minutes later: ""words from the crew? nothing? attention to quarters! relieve the watches.""

i didn't have a watch to relieve, so that was my signal to sprint to the head. i reached a stall, slammed the door shut, and threw down my trousers as i sat. the relief was great, the sound was horrifying, and the stench was like the sound. after the sense of urgency died down, i glanced down toward my boots. something in the toilet bowl caught my eye.

oh. oh no. sitting in the water, soaked and with an ugly little mudpie on top of it, was my cover.

at that point, the best i could do was fish it out, try my best to fling the shit off of it into the bowl, and wash it off in the basin used to fill mop buckets. a few hours on top of a heater vent, and it was dry. no perceptible odor.","i was in a rush to shit, my hat fell into the water before my shit did."
193,"in the grand scheme of fuck-ups, this one is relatively minor. but here it is anyway.

reddit, i hate cooking. the fact that we need to eat to survive is something i view as an inconvenience. if science could develop some sort of tablet that provided us with all our needed nutrients and calories i would be a happy camper. as such, easy recipes are a must. 

enter the crock pot.

it took me six years of living on my own (parents never used one growing up) to discover the possibilities, but once i did, i was hooked. just pile some meat and veggies into that sumbitch, go to sleep, and have meals for days. fuck. yes.

what i'm assuming happened (i don't exactly remember) is this:

it's monday morning. i'm running late for work. i shovel some crock pot-y goodness into a tupperware container for lunch and dump the rest into another for the days to come. i put the lid back on my pot and go.

my week is busy. i work full time and do quite a bit of volunteering on the side. maybe i came home monday night and said, ""i'll clean you tomorrow, crock pot."" 

but tomorrow never came. the crock pot disappeared into the corner of my counter, obscured by newly purchased bottles of wine. i tired of my diet of slow cooked meals and regressed to my old habits of baking things in my toaster oven and putting avocado on them. the pot was forgotten. 

fast forward to today (what i'm approximating to be six weeks or so later). i'm leaving for work, running late, as usual. the crock pot catches the corner of my eye. a knot forms in my stomach as the reality of the situation hits me. i peer into its depths and gasp at the landscape before me.

the walls are covered by a soft coating of blue mold, cascading down into a congealed mass of brain tissue-esque fungi. a brown, syrupy sheen reflects off the crock pot floor. overcome by anger, regret, and horror, i leave for work, vowing to slay the beast when i come home.

it haunted me, tifu. i couldn't get the image out of my mind. for nine hours of work and one hour of spin class i considered my plan of attack.  

as i pulled up to my apartment, i was ready. as fate would have it, i work in a tuberculosis clinic. like many infectious disease professionals, i carry an n95 mask in my bag. (n95 masks are designed to filter out 95% of small particles in the air.) i strapped it on and stuck a tea bag in there for good measure (it helps with the smell). my cat looked on in horror as i donned my rubber gloves. 

i removed the lid and let the crock pot fill with hot water. the congealed mass of mold floated to the top and slipped out. as i leaned over my sink to poke it down the drain the smell hit me. i took a step back and let the tea bag do its job. once the aroma of green ginger tea had cancelled out the month old vomit like stench of god knows what, i returned to my task. 

the pot now sits in my sink, soaking in a bath of dish soap and water. my kitchen is coated in a fine mist of febreze, and my cat does not understand why we are not playing laser pointer. so, i'll end my story here, and hope to christ that i don't let anything in my kitchen get that fucking disgusting ever again.","forgot to clean my crock pot, pot filled up with nasty ass mold."

back in college, i worked in a shoe store. i'm very helpful and also very annoyed when ignored, which is by far my biggest pet peeve. this middle aged man (ah = asshole) was admiring our fine selection of fashionable footwear and i approach him from behind with a casual, ""hello sir, how are you doing today? can i help you find anything?""
ah didn't even give me the courtesy of acknowledging my greeting. so i repeat a little louder, ""can i help you find something?"" again, ignored. i think to myself, ""what the hell, man? what's your problem?""

i say ""if you need anything, please find me."" nothing. and then, as i walk by, ah gives me a (perceived) snooty glance. ooooohhh that sonofabitch! he has the gall to ignore me then look at me condescendingly. he's a dick and i will announce this to everyone. i help two more customers and comment (loudly) that ""some customers are ungrateful and should get off their high horse."" and ""some people look down on others for working retail"" and yada yada yada

(massive wall of text alert)

so, i'm 16/17, almost finished comprehensive school (high school). there's a girl in my year who i get on pretty well with, she's not really part of the ""in"" crowd, seems to have a few nerdish interests, and isn't terrible looking. so me, having watched way too much tv, thinks = she should be my girlfriend. now, i was always a bit awkward/uncomfortable around ""the ladies"", hadn't had any real contact with the other sex at this point, so maybe i was a bit starved for it. so we're sitting in the common room, it's a friday, there's a long weekend up ahead, i'm psyching myself up for it - just do it man, ask her out, fucking do it. bell goes, end of the day fuck i run up to her as we're all leaving, i'm like ""hey, do you fancy seeing a movie tonight"" ""yeah sure"" yes! ""who's all going"" fuck! ""um, i was thinking just the two of us....?"" ""um, okay"" yes! i head home, catch my buddy on the bus, ""she fucking said yes"" i'm feeling like dirk fucking diggler.

i get home, there's a phone call on the landline, it's her. she says she wanted to say no earlier but didn't want to hurt my feelings fuck! but we can still go to the movie as friends. i'm devastated but thinking a casual trip to the cinema might clear the air a bit, stop it being awkward at school on tuesday (!!). there's no cinema in our two-bit town, we have to get the train to a slightly bigger neighbouring one. 20 min on the train, polite small talk, a bit awkward. feeling confused about the whole thing. we get to the cinema and see what's on. it's slim pickings, and it's after 9, films are starting. we need to see something, she's hemming and hawwing, i'm getting impatient, ""let's just go see this one here"". what did i pick? the remake of assault on district 13 -- why??

we're sitting in the dark, i'm looking over at her -- i know she's not enjoying this film at all. i'm feeling like crap -- this was a mistake. what am i doing here? i zone out and watch laurence fishburne shoot scumbag'[s for a while. it's nearly over, she leans over and is like ""maybe we should leave if we want to get the last train home"". i'm all it's cool babes we got all the time in the world. nope we get out, make a dash to the station, it's all locked up. fuck! no idea what we're going to do -- this was before mobile phones. i locate a phone box on the street, and there's taxi numbers taped up inside it phew! so i get taxi and it drives up down the motorway back to our town, i sit in the front seat, she's in the back -- weird awkward silence plus standard taxi driver banter for like 20 minutes. we finally get back to the town, he drops us off at the train station. i'm like thank god this nightmare is over. i ask when her dad is picking her up, i thought she'd mentioned that earlier, she says she's actually walking home. she lives on the outskirts of the town, its a solid walk -- why didn't you mention this in the taxi? 

i can't let this girl walk home alone, friday night, it's super late and the outskirts can be a bit sketchy. so i volunteer to accompany her, we're 15 min into our journey when the rain and hail starts. i give her my jacket. we're trudging along, both miserable and pretty wet by this point. the smalltalk is dying a death. we finally get to her house, she's like ""thanks, do you remember the way home?"" ""yeah babes no problem for me!"" nope i get fucking lost. i'm wandering around, starting to panic cos i've no phone or anything and i'm terrified of bumping into a bunch of pissed yahoos at this hour. then the storm really starts. thunder, wind. it's a real, king lear on the heath storm. why did i not take my jacket back? i'm soaked through, lost. finally stumble upon a shop i recognize, ok i can get my bearings. find a road, navigate the tarmac back into town. the storm is still raging, like the universe is laughing at my poor, poor judgement. get home at some point, wishing silently that i can crawl into my room on the quiet, my mom opens the front door sauced up, in the middle of a party, beaming ""soooo how it go???"" i'm mortified by the whole experience, just gotta get to bed, this whole thing's been a russian doll of regret.

tuesday rolls around. it's pre facebook, so my mates don't know how things went. i get into form class. they're excited. how'd it go mate? did you get a kiss?

not quite...

**","asked out  girl, she said yes, then no; went on a ""date"" anyway. she got wet.**"
202,"my best friend is home for the first time in four months (she lives two hours away) so we decided to get super high. i get the sensation that i have to pee. i ignore it both because i am ridiculously high and my friend is telling a story....finally i get up to go to the bathroom, walk up the stairs and it happens....the flood gates open and the golden river flows...fuck! fast forward a few minutes and i am in the bathroom wondering how i am going to  change clothes without my husband or best friend wondering what the fuck i am doing. thankfully my husband had a pair of pajama pants laying on the sink in the bathroom. i put those on and casually walk back to the basement hoping again, they won't notice....but they did and now they won't stop laughing.... oh well lol.",got high and ignored the fact had to pee and pissed myself; tried to cover it up but they figured it out.
203,"this happened a few years ago, but it's probably my biggest tifu.

 so i woke up one morning with an intense urge to vomit.

i start running towards the bathroom and make it four steps before i start projectile vomiting everywhere. i apparently also had diarrhea and the force of of me throwing up also caused me to shit my pants. 

i'm not done so i continue trying to get to the bathroom and am now dripping in feces and last night's dinner. i make it to the stairs and throw up/shit myself again, but as i am running down steep stairs i slip on my own filth and hit my head on the steps knocking myself out.

i wake up now bleeding slightly, covered in shit and puke and see my dad looking over me and tell him ""i don't think i can go to school today"" 

he looks over me and says ""no, i don't think you can."" 

i spent the rest of the day with my head in a bucket and my ass on the shitter. i have no idea what made me sick but it was the grossest thing that has ever happened to me.

 

edit: i did not knock myself up. my sex ed is apparently a little off",had explosive diarrhea and projectile vomiting and as i was running down the stairs i slipped in my vomit/shit and knocked myself out. didn't have to go to school.
204,"this happened several months ago, but i just decided to post it here.

so a few months ago someone at my school committed suicide, the 2nd one in less than a month, obviously it was a very tough time for everyone. at his funeral, 2 kids were joking around (this may sound inappropriate, but it was appropriate, you'd have to be there) and one of them said ""everyone hates you!"" in a joking manner. i said (oh jesus...), ""careful, we don't want another one!"" both their faces immediately went serious and they walked away. oops. i couldn't even apologize because i couldn't spit out any words after i said it. the worst part was i said it rather loudly so everyone around me heard it too, i could feel their stares burning into me.","made a suicide joke at the funeral for a kid who committed suicide, made everyone hate me."
205,"yes, it’s a poop story.

my girlfriend’s mom has been visiting for the past week and the three of us (me, girlfriend, and mom) have been doing fun, touristy day activities. yesterday my stomach was grumbly after a spicy meal. normal, though, right? i had a nasty shit in a public restroom at some touristy site and thought it was done. nope.

that night, the beast returned. he took his vengeance upon my bowels and made them rain hell upon my own private toilet. still didn’t feel great. woke up the next morning and he was there again. aside from the fact that my asshole was rubbed as raw as ground meat, i felt much better after that one. i thought i had exorcised the demon and set off for a hike with girlfriend and mom. 

the hike was on an out-and-back trail up a big hill. the path was barely wide enough for two people to stand side by side, and stupidly, we had chosen a sunny, 90f day. we stopped frequently for water breaks because mom was feeling dizzy. i’m feeling fine, pleased that the exorcism was effective.  we are 80% to the top of the hill and decide to turn back because of the heat, when bam the beast lets loose his rumbling growl. i take no more than 10 steps before i know my asshole will not remained closed for a single step more. i had already warned my girlfriend of my digestive troubles, and told her to take mom up ahead. 

as i mentioned the trail was narrow and on a hot, sunny hill. plenty of people walking by, but at this point, i have no room for shame. only urgency, and excruciating pain. i waddle to a switchback, clenching my asscheeks tight to hold in the shit that wants out. pull down my pants, get them out of the splash zone, and before i give the go ahead, it’s coming out. what came out cannot even be described as poop, because that implies something semi-solid and brown. instead, i released a yellowish pinkish goo, the consistency of a pineapple-mango juice mixed with v8.

now came the problem of wiping. this is a hill in the desert, and the largest leaf on any plant was the size of my thumb. all i had with me was my water bottle. i had no other choice. i wet down my non-dominant hand, wiped up the remaining goo, pulled up my pants, and emptied most of my remaining water onto my desecrated hand. the offending pile stunk like roadkill and i ran the fuck out of there before anyone came by. 

i catch up with girlfriend and mom. they ask if i’m ok and i request to just get down the hill. unfortunately, there is still shit-juice smeared all over my inner thighs, and each step down the hill chafes open the flesh and infuses it with said shit-juice. finally, we reach the car and drive to a diner where i can clean up better. i then have to sit through an entire meal (some nice, handheld burgers to complement my shit-covered hand) before i can go home and take i shower.

after my shower, i took a several hour nap and calmed my shame, knowing that in the end, i had conquered the beast. 

 

edit: for the record, i, lionlament, am the girlfriend in the story. my boyfriend is a sissy lurker who is too afraid of rejection to post anything on reddit.",went on a hike in the desert while having diarrhea and wiped with my hand.
206,"so, i am at work when my bladder sends that little message to my brain to indicate its ready to be emptied.  to the head (wc/bathroom) i go.  in the head are two urinals with a privacy divider in between.  a gentleman is all ready using one, so i pull up in front to the other and start my business.  certain sounds are inevitable and its clear the other guy is done.  a rather loud audible shaking sound is heard then i felt something on my hand.  i look down and realized the guy just shook his snake so damn hard that he slung **at least** one drop of his urine over the privacy barrier - and it landed on my hand!!  what. the. fuck???  
  
i look over to the guy and exclaimed (loudly), ""dude, you don't have to shake your snake so damn hard that it's neck breaks.  you just slung piss on me over here.""  there was a dead silence while this guy seemed to think of something to say.  he mutters ""sorry"" and hastily leaves out of the head - without washing his hands.  after he left, it also occurred to me that i had not heard a re-zipping of his pants - so ... i hope is is not flashing anyone.","went to the head, dude next to me excessively shook his snake and slung his urine onto my hand."
207,"i woke up this morning next to my boyfriend having slept over at my house. woke up with morning wetness and by defult not given much thought of it since it's a normal thing to me. we had breakfast with my sister and had a very amusing conversation resulting in plenty of laughter. the sweater i wore made me sweat bullets, it was very warm in the kitchen since my mom frozen the previous day and drawn up the raidiator temprature. 

i had to get up to go to the bathroom but instead of going and making my business i found myself staring at a horrible starshaped mark made by my pussy. damn it i had accidentaly pushed out my wetness by laughing so hard and covered my labias with it successfully marking the poor kitchen chair cushion. 

i was mortified: my boyfriend and sister laughed at me. to add to the awkwardness: today is my younger sister's 17th birthday so this won't be forgotten easily. luckily did my sister not realize it was wetness since i exclamed how awkward it was that i'd had so much sweat on my inner thighs that it stained the cushion. my boyfriend was a different deal thoe, he just laughed his ass off. i wanted to clean it up but since my the whole family is going to visit tonight to celebrate my sister i realized that i couldn't make it in time. so... awkwardly enough one of my relatives will sit on the other side of the cushion that has my wing mark under it.

conclusion made, i will never skip my pre-breakfast bathroom visit ever again.",vag stamp on cushion
208,"i look after people's houses while they are away sometimes. this one time i was at this particular house downtown chicago (river north) i had to drop one badly. every house i go to is usually on the market and usually as empty as it gets so using their master bathroom was as easy as checking to make sure they had adequate tp. now every time i go to this house i have to crap - can't explain that. but anyways, today i was there and, again, i had to drop one. so as usual i go up to the third floor master bathroom and have myself a seat. just then i hear a commotion downstairs. i think to myself *this is strange, did i leave a window open and i can just hear outside...?* nope that door just closed and somebody is here while i am pooping in the master bathroom. 

i am wiping and trying to get my shorts back on as fast as possible while not making obvious ""struggling to get my pants on"" noises as to not give away what was just going on upstairs. it is a real estate agent there to show the place. i throw my bag on my shoulder and proceed downstairs in a bit of a rush. ""so i guess i can trust that you will just lock the place up?"" i say. ""yes"" he says and i walk right out as fast as possible. i leave the house and walk across the street and halfway down the block to the train station. at this point i notice things are a bit breezy. i look down and...  dick is out. not peeking through but hanging out, out. i forgot to mention that i have not worn boxers in about 5 years. the real estate agent and everybody just stared but i couldn't care less. i laughed out loud to myself because what the hell else could i have done there. besides underwear.","real estate agent caught me using the bathroom in a client's house, in my haste to get out and cover my tracks i didn't zip and the entire north side of chicago saw my dong before i noticed. i realize i should wear boxers now."
209,"tifu by not drinking enough water (for several days in a row, actually).  i'm on new medications that each severely dehydrate me, and during the summer i had no problem downing a bottle of water and peeing every hour or so, but now that school is back in session i'm not able to do that anymore.

didn't really take note of the fact that i hadn't pooped on a couple of days, so when i go to the bathroom for my nightly ablutions and feel that familiar urge, i plop myself down, whip out the phone, and get myself settled in for a satisfying poop.  about a minute and a half in, i realize that this is not going to be a satisfying poop.

things are moving alone and i hear something hit the water, but there's still a lot to go.  i'm taking the driest shit ever.  little to mid-sized pieces are falling off the slow-moving but extremely thick poop torpedo stuck up my asshole.  i'm straining, i'm shimmying, i'm squeezing and pushing, all trying to get my little turd-baby moving.  

nothing is working.  my asshole is stretched to its limit. it's actually kind of like an ass vacuum in reverse--the first bit has fallen away (courtesy flush) but the next part hasn't moved further down.  quite literally wedged beyond reach in my lower rectum.  

so after a good 40 minutes with no progress, i'm starting to have the terrible fear that i'm going to pop a brain aneurysm and die on the shitter.  felt like leaving a note that would inform my loved ones that i wanted to be buried with the turd baby, and what name to give it on my tombstone.  my choices are currently die on toilet, call someone for help, or, be my own damn fine hero.

so i steel myself, grab a few lengths of toilet paper, and then reach under and back ... and start digging in my own stretched out asshole to remove the giant blockage of dense, backed-up, compressed shit-pellets from my own anus.  that's right, i'm digging in my own bung-hole to remove poop piece-by-bloody-mucus-covered-piece. my finger quickly breaks through the toilet paper guard, and my finger is mushing around in sticky, warm shit that is so well packed in my rectum.  and each piece sticks to my finger as i try to work it out, and i go through a roll of tp wiping the shit off my finger and the bloody-slimy goo from around my asshole.

finally i got it all, or enough that my asshole could close again.  i spent the next twenty minutes washing my in hot-as-fuck soapy water.  it's two hours later and my asshole still burns.",today i fucked up and had to shovel shit of out my own anus.**
210,"if you're anything like me when it comes to brushing your teeth, you may find the task boring.  i attempt to multitask while brushing, which usually extends the action.  tonight's multitasking consisted of brushing, watching the daily show and redditing with my laptop.  i was about 10 minutes into the brushing when the incident occurred.

by this point i have a good mouthful of tooth paste and various liquid by-products accumulated (as my fellow marathon-brushers will be familiar with).  i felt the first tickle, but thought i could suppress the sneeze with the usual trick (feel along your nose until you reach the end of the bone / start of the cartilage and then press into the nose, usually works surprisingly well) but to no avail.  i realized my mistake and tried to compensate, but the couch was reclined and my laptop positioned in its usual spot.  with the nearest sink at least 10 paces away, i knew i wasn't going to make it and braced for the eruption by quickly sealing my mouth.

the sneeze came less than one step from the sink.  i had clenched my mouth so tight that i thought the sneeze would come out my nose, but i'm also a little stuffed up right now, causing a backfire and unsealing my mouth.  my bottom lip lost its grip and the contents of my mouth (at least 2 fluid oz at this point) shot straight up, striking my nose and covering the mirror / faucet / wall with the tooth paste, spit and snot.  due to the trajectory, i managed to hit everything in front of my except the sink.

my nose is burning, my throat feels like someone punched it, but at least my left nostril is no longer clogged.  i can still smell the brush by-product.  i think i need a shower.

211,"well, it was yesterday, but fuck it. 

i have an ex girlfriend that lives about an hour from my place of residence (can't really call my frat house ""home""). we've always been pretty cordial, and because there's never really been a fair shot for us to have a healthy, legitimate relationship, there's some feelings that have been dormant on both sides. we make plans to hang out, with a full understanding that sex will be involved barring some extreme circumstance or fuckup. i get excited.

reddit, i need to open up for a hot minute - i have confidence issues with my performance/size/body makeup (honestly, only the last one is remotely valid). we made out for a while and did high school-esque handsy shit. here's where things get fun - we stop dead in our tracks, have a ten minutes discussion on the implications of having sex (where both of us lose our respective drives), that ends with her saying ""okay, let's go.""

she bounces up, immediately strips naked, lays down and spreads 'em. /u/mmmdddmmm, you're in the clear! this is what every guy wants to happen! 

..............nothing.

okay, it's whatever, maybe if i go down on her, i'll get turned on. i do, and she comes (tornado tongue ftw). now it's time to put it in! i reach down for my dick....

..........

.................

........................

soft as a pillow yet again. 

alright, maybe if there's some more foreplay - oh my god she's going down on me and i still can't fucking pop a boner. 

i panicked, made an excuse about not taking medication (which was true - i'm on a little steroid pack for a viral infection, but it was a last day so i'm sure i didn't die), and noped the fuck outta there, tail between my legs and highly embarrassed. i asked if everything was okay and she just gave me the ""fine"" answer. 

and now today conversation is nothing but awkward. holy shit, i fucked up.","my dick wanted some, then got stage fright, which may have fucked up a friendship."
212,"i'm on the swim team. i'm not one of the good swimmers, but i still go because it's a good way to exercise. 
so here i am at the end of practice. we're practicing our dives and such. my first two dives go well, just a slight belly flop. however, on my last dive, i didn't tuck my chin down and went face first. 
at first, i was like ""haha wow shit my nose hurts, that'd suck if i got a nosebleed"" which everyone laughed at. 
but then, 3 minutes later...
the niagara falls of nosebleeds is coming out of my face. awkwardly, i quickly walked (don't run on the deck, children) to my towel and proceeded to bleed all over that.",i'm on the road to the olympics.
213,"little bit of back story:

girl and i have been friends for going on 4 years now. we've really dragged each other through some shit over that time, failed relationships, a mutual friend's divorce, problems with school and work and life, etc. she's always been there for me when i needed someone to listen, and i've always tried to help her through whatever problems crop up in her life.

me? i'm a habitual fuck-up when it comes to anything involving emotions or expressing myself, and i tend to repress feelings of frustration and aggression. i think it's a coping mechanism for when i don't feel like i've got control of my life, like i choose not to feel instead of actually confronting the thing that's causing me to feel that way. she's the kind of girl that wears her heart on her sleeve, essentially, and that's a very endearing quality to me because it helps me associate with my own emotions. it's been very helpful over the past 7 or 8 months since i've moved across the country to start a new job. it's lonely here and my friends back home, her especially, have been so supportive and helpful.

anyway, that bit is important because for about a year now i've been trying to convince myself that i'm not romantically interested in girl, despite the fact that i've caught myself looking at her in a way that i typically reserve for lovers. and we have fooled around in the past so i didn't think much about it (just hormones, etc.). last time i was in town (october) we ended up having sex, after which she drove me to the airport and we said our goodbyes. neither one of us has really mentioned the event, but i've been thinking about her more and more over the past month as i've been helping her deal with school related problems. 

so last night:

i came back from my evening run feeling the worse for wear. i'm trying to train up for a 15k back home this coming saturday that girl has asked me to run with her. fuck me i'm not a runner! but she's worth the effort so here i am pushing myself through cold and rain. well, i get home and i text her that i want to facetime and talk a bit. she replies back that she's got a meeting real soon and she can't, but she really wants to talk to me because she's stressed and also that *she wants to tell me about this* **new guy** *she met*. what? fuck? i thought i had more time!

i was planning on telling her how i felt this weekend, and i think i panicked a little. she caught on that something was amiss and called me up. so there i am, heart pounding, legs tight and fingers numb, looking into the face of a girl who doesn't know the train wreck that's about to crash into her from a thousand miles away.

i play it cool. ""so, i've got a problem i think you can help me out with."" ""ok, i'll try,"" she says to me with a look on her face like she has more pressing concerns on her mind. and i could tell she wasn't expecting anything, which just made it harder. but i'm already in this far, can't back out now. i go on to tell her that there's this girl i like and i don't know how to tell her how i feel. we go back and forth on some questions, and she figures out pretty quickly that i'm being a coy motherfucker and calls me out. 

""is it me...?"" lump in my throat. ""...maybe?"" *wry smile and puppy dog eyes*. silence. silence grows into awkward pause. then the next 5 minutes is her looking like she's recovering from a car crash and me desperately trying to explain that i can't help how i feel. ""maybe i'm just being an idiot,"" i say. ""i didn't want to tell you like this, but i can't help how i feel and i wanted you to know."" and she's obviously distraught, and our conversation keeps getting interrupted as her sister enters and exits her room so the awkwardness only exasperates. finally i just go and say, ""i can't help the way i feel. *i love you and i can't change that.*"" she looks like a deer in headlights. ""i have to go to my meeting, i'm really sorry i don't know what to say right now..."" boom. done. conversation ends.

and here i am today, wearing my dunce hat and feeling like a total selfish asshole. i've fucked up a lot in my life, reddit. but last night, i think, was my crowning glory. please induct me into the hall of fucked.",: i told my friend of the last 4 years i loved her. now she's in shock and i feel like an asshat.
214,"**context:** happened last week. i teach english abroad and this had been a topic of conversation in a hostel dorm room for several people.

i checked into a hostel, got up to my dorm, and quickly introduced to myself to the other 2 people in the room, lets call them mary and sue. mary was a nice girl from germany who got to chatting with me. i said hello to sue, but she pretended not to hear me.

*fast forward*

i start noticing some strange things about sue: she lit a candle and blew it out again and again. when we finally fall asleep, she starts having night terrors, screaming things like ""don't touch me, get away from me, no no no,!"" the next morning, mary tells me that sue had been crying the whole day before. i start to think she had gone through some abuse recently.

*fast forward*

we're all in the room, she starts to cry again, and i asked, ""are you okay?"" with no response. i said it again, and oh boy did i make a mistake. she went into this rant about how all english teachers do is rape their children, rape their students, rob their host countries, and neglect to learn the culture or language. she continued to say that if i would like to speak to her, i should speak to her in her native tongue, finnish (ignoring the irony of conveying this message in perfect english). i was told to stop bullying her, that i denied her the right to lay in her bed, that i couldn't possibly have anything valuable to retort because i'm english (i'm american).

that night, i feared for my life.

 

*edit:* not all finnish people are crazy. just this one.",asked a girl if she was okay and got called a child rapist.
215,"im currently a third year in college and the last time i wrote an essay since my first year.  i've always been pretty terrible at writing and reading in general which is why i am a science major (to this day i question how i was admitted into any school).  the reason i suck at writing analytical essays is because i can't analyze text its that simple.  i take everything very literal and don't question anything.  

my paper was only 800 words so its basically not even a college paper.  the same week it was due i had 3 very difficult midterms for my major so i went to my ta and told her how difficult of a week id been having.  i told her i sucked at writing and was very illiterate (i meant literal), she immediately began laughing and i didn't know why.  i explained how i sucked at analyzing stuff and she just kept laughing.  as i was walking out she asked what my major, i said biopsych and she then said, ""that explains everything!""  

i then went home really confused as to why she had laughed and told my roommates i had said to her that i suck at reading context clues and said i was illiterate, then began laughing and told me that i had basically told her i couldn't read instead of saying literal. 

i almost wanted to send her email and apologize for being half stupid but i couldn't get myself to do it.",:  told my ta i was illiterate instead of literal and she didn't correct me.
216,"i was gutting my bathroom. just some remodeling. i tore the drywall out and got to the old insulation. i've never had a problem with insulation itching so i went at it bare handed.

gutting took no time at all. so i go to start putting new insulation in. after hours of the remolding i decided to take a shower.

now swamp ass got going during the remodel and being the classy guy i am, i decide to soap up my hand and shove my hand between my ass cheeks. rubbing and scrubbing away, i start to feel a tingle. my ass crack is on fire. it feel like shards of glass are shooting in and out. i grab the shower head and shove it in my ass. no relief. cold water. no relief. 

i just had to wait it out. its calmed down now. fuck it was rough. asshole still itches.",got insulation in my asscrack and hole. always wear gloves.
217,"i was babysitting and i had to use the bathroom, so i go in there and i remember noticing that the toilet bowl was a little more full than it probably should've been. but i went ahead anyway and when i flushed the toilet it started filling with water but not draining. i kinda just stood there while the water reached the top and started pouring out onto the floor. i grabbed a cup from the counter and started scooping water out of the toilet and into the sink. after a couple minutes of that when the sink was full too, i realized the fucking sink was clogged also! so i started pouring it into the shower. once the water stopped flowing and i scooped out enough water so that it wouldn't overflow, i took a bunch of toilet paper to try and clean up the flooded floor. after a few minutes of wiping i realized i couldn't even flush the soaked toilet paper down the toilet... so i had this nasty pile of soaking toilet paper sitting on the floor. so now the sink is full. the toilet is clogged. the shower is all wet. the floor is flooded. and there's a bunch of wet toilet paper on the floor. i kind of managed to clean most of the mess up but i decided to never ever babysit again. 

i'm sure the comments will be filled (pun intended) with things i could've done differently to make this outcome better but whatever. it was hard to think straight.","the house i'm babysitting at now has a gross, flooded bathroom and a full toilet and sink."
218,"it's nearly midnight, i have literally just got back from a&e, and truth be told im pretty tired, so please forgive any spelling/grammar mistakes :)

so tonight, i got home from work, decided to catch up on my youtube subs (as i do every evening :p). so i was looking around for my headphones, after about 10 minutes of scouring through my drawers, i realize that i left them at work.

in the end i manage to find an old pair of jvc marshmallow headphones and used them instead. fast forward an hour to when i take them out to go grab some food at about 7:30pm, except only half of the right ear bud comes out, leaving a rubber tubing stuck in my ear.

in a moronic panic, i decide the cleverest thing to do is to attempt to get the tiny rubber tube out, with my fat sausage fingers, needless to say the tube end's up further in my ear. oh shit.

next plan of action was to try and get it out with a pair of tweezers, it took all of a 2 seconds for me to come to the conclusion that jabbing my inner ear with a pair of jagged metal prongs in a panic was going to end badly... so i gave up and decided to go to a&e.

i was starting feel a bit uneasy at this point as this thing was deep in my ear, and it was starting to hurt. so there i am explaining to receptionist, that i'm a 19 year old man, who has a piece of rubber stuck in his ear. im not sure how healthcare works around the rest of the world, but with the nhs in the uk, they tell anyone who comes in to take a seat, and they treat by severity of the case.

so i take a seat opposite two girls who are both sobbing, one has their arm bandaged, the other her stomach, with blood all over them, from what i can understand, they were attacked by some dogs. i could hear through on of their sobs, that they had been sat there for over an hour, and were still waiting, and there was me sat with some rubber stuck in my ear like a curious toddler, this is when it dawned on me that it was going to be a very long night.

after about 2 1/2 hours the nurse called my name and i went through to a room that had all sorts of prongs and needle-nose pliers, ""oh so no syringe and water?"" i said in a half joke half kind of way, to which he replied with a stern ""no."" 

well fuck. this was going to be uncomfortable.

and it was, he spent about 5 minutes ramming metal into my ear, tugging at random on skin and hair until he managed to finally dig out the little rubber tube. 

sweet relief, at last! 

deeply appreciative, i thanked the man, turns out they see this thing really often with in-ear earphones, which made me feel a bit less stupid, although admittedly not that much..

so that's that, my ear is still pounding, and the nurse was pretty sure i'd get an ear infection, good thing i'm holiday next week. -_-

 


edit: the small grey thing is what got stuck.

http://www.localnumber69.com/temp/headphones/100_0649.jpg","decided to listen to some music, ear bud got stuck in my ear, had to spend the night at a&e waiting to get it removed, and i'll likely get an ear infection.**"
219,"i'm a bit of a slob.  i leave my clothes lying around, i'll often leave soda cans and beer bottles at my desk for days before i expend the energy to toss them in the recycling, and generally the only time i make my bed is when i first put on a fresh set of sheets.  so tonight  i laid down in my unmade bed, same as any other night.  as i lay there in the dark, waiting for sleep to overtake me, my thoughts turned to an old crush whom i hadn't thought of in a while. i imagined taking her back to her place after a date and giving her a passionate good-night kiss at her door.  she invited me in, and, as i proceeded to imagine making out on her couch, i began fapping.

the imagined make-out session grew more intense; clothes started coming off, more intimate areas were kissed, sucked, and fondled, and i decided to adjust my masturbation technique.  see, when i first began exploring my body as a small child, i discovered that it felt really nice to take a sheet or towel and just kind of grind my junk into it with my hips. this has the advantage of being more of a full-body experience and closer to actual sex and i used this technique exclusively for years before discovering the more traditional tricep workout. it also has the disadvantage of being fairly messy since the full volume of your load goes right into your bedsheet; as a result, i generally only do this when it's about time for my sheets to go to the laundry anyway.  i'd been sleeping on these sheets for a while (again, slob), so i decided tonight was the night not to hold back.

i reached down toward the foot of my bed and grabbed the bed sheet that was crumpled up there and started doing my thing.  at one point, i noticed that one part of the sheet was cooler than the rest.  i had a fan running by the bed, so i figured that area had just been in the fan's path, so i paid it no mind.  as i continued to rub and gyrate while my fantasy girl and i went at it with reckless abandon, i noticed that the sheet was not just cool, but moist.  it was at that point that i stopped what i was doing, turned my light on, and discovered that my cat had vomited on my mattress and covered up her crime with the crumpled bed sheet. i had been humping cat puke. i just finished cleaning the bulk of the mess, stripping the bed and putting the sheets in my laundry bag, putting on new sheets, and cleaning off the affected areas of my nether regions. my libido, suffice to say, has been squelched for the night, and i'm about to go back to bed and think long and hard about just what it was that i had against dogs.",fucked vomit
220,"i [21m] work at a media corporation, and i was working on a high school sports story about a notable team of cross country girls. sorry to be vague, but i’m trying to leave out identifying details.

anyway, i was talking to the coach, and he was speaking about one of the girls in particular who is a star athlete, the second fastest in our state. not only that, but she is an honors student, and consistently gets good grades.

hearing this, i commented that she sounds like an incredibly well-developed girl. 

the conversation halted, and he went silent. i explained that i meant well-rounded, but it didn’t ease the awkwardness.

it’s a good thing this interview was over the phone. my face was *reeeed.*",– tifu by misspeaking and suggesting a high school girl was well-endowed.**
221,"well as the title suggests, we were on a road trip.
we had stopped at a petrol station about 10 kms back, but i chose not to go because of the appalling state of all of the rest rooms. what i had done at this particular stop was buy a whole bunch of snacks for the road, and subsequently eaten them all. so at this point we (my parents, sister and i) are driving down a corrugated gravel road in a crappy honda crv when it happened. the car hit a particularly large bump and it surprised me enough to make me poop a little.

 now, you may be thinking that this is the tifu, but no, it gets much worse.

this small piece of poop was apparently acting as a plug to stop what i can only describe as a torrential downpour of diarrhea from flowing out of my butt. with its removal, i released said diarrhea that had been churning and groaning inside of me like a particularly upset fetus all over my seat, floor, blankets, baggage and sister. i would have laughed had i not just emptied my own digestive track all over my belongings sitting at my feet. we hurriedly pulled over to the side of the road and i am sitting 10m down the road from my disgusted family to shield myself from their harsh words.","shaken, not stirred."
222,"so this happened saturday night, but close enough. i was visiting a girl at her university. i found this girl extremely attractive and really wanted to make a good impression on her since this was one of the first times i had spent extended time with her. well we all started drinking saturday night and i had a bit too much. when i say a bit too much i'm talking like 12-16 shots of 70-100 proof liquor in the span of 3-4 hours. it was rough. i ended up puking in front of everyone and basically just embarrassing the hell out of myself. now we aren't talking anymore (no surprise there), and i don't know if i'll be able to fix the relationship.

i had a reason for drinking, but i can't tell her because it's kind of a cop out, but whatever, i can tell you guys. i have depression and anxiety issues, and i'm also being tested for bipolar disorder. this weekend happened to be one of the ones that was on the downward swing, and i used alcohol to cope with the depression and anger creeping inside me. that was not a smart move as evidenced by drinking way more than i could handle. i am quite upset that i ruined a good looking relationship, and now i don't know what to do with myself. i'm just venting at this point, but that was my fuck-up.","i drank too much, puked in front of a romantic interest, now we are no longer speaking."
223,"a long while ago in the middle of the night i needed to go to the bathroom so i got up and started heading to the potty(or thats what i called it at the time) and there was a laundry basket just sitting there.

so i tripped over it and hit my head on the side of the door frame. i dont remember much, but i remember seeing red, passing out, waking up, and looking in my mirror and seeing skull. then i passed out again. and, the next day i got 9 stitches in my forehead. woo hoo",i fell and hit my head on a door frame. stitches commenced
224,"yesterday (wasn't today but close enough), i was sitting in my dorm room just doing some homework. out of the corner of me i see a fucking mosquito that has probably been the one pissing me off at night so i had a rush of adrenaline. 

after a few attempts to clap it between my hands with little success, i wait for it to land on the wall. so, it lands on the wall and i slam it as hard as i can and for some reason i yelled, ""welcome to america, bitch!"" as i slammed it. no big deal right. well, i forgot that an international student from china lives in the room next to me and the wall i slammed is the one between our rooms. i hope she doesn't think i'm too racist.",killed a mosquito and sounded like an asshole.
225,"well, it didn't happen today, but you understand.

during the summer, my mom wanted me to get out of the house more, since we had just moved in town.  so, i decide to start going to my local gaming store to play some magic: the gathering (a card game, for those who don't know).  one day, i decided to stop at the nearby gas station for a drink.  i threw it in a shitty fabric bag i got from my school at the end of the year, because it was a fountain drink, and i can't ride my bike with one hand.  the bag was slung over the front of the handle bars.  well, i got there, blah, blah, blah, had fun.  i was headed home, and i had thrown my deck box in the bag, which i hadn't thought of actually wearing, instead of having it hang precariously.  about halfway home, my deck box decided to lodge itself between the shock and the wheel of my front tire, locking up the front wheel.  i was thrown over the handlebars, and i sprained my wrist a bit.  the box was stuck in there good, so i couldn't get it out in my injured state.  after dragging my bike most of the way home, some random dude helped me get the box dislodged, and i rode the rest of the way home.  luckily, nothing worth anything was damaged.","i left my brain at home, and sprained my wrist because i like to play card games."
226,"so my newlywed sister and husband are staying at our parents' house for the week. they just got here a day ago and since her and my brother moved out, my room is the only one that isn't used for storage. so they take my room (which is actually my brothers but i stole it when he left) and i took the basement. i like the basement, it's nice, cool and has a tv. anyways, it was last night when we all went to bed and i was a little drunk off wine so i felt like looking at some porn. this is the part where i fucked up.

so i'm looking at porn on my tablet. it's an old tablet but i usually just use a remote desktop viewer to hook up with my computer so i can do everything a computer can do and my tablet just has to deal with the video. well.....my computer was in my room. i knew this, but i also know that the monitors were off. i also was under the impression that the stereo hooked up to my computer was turned off as well. i also knew that my tablet by default will turn off the computer sound and route the sound through my tablet. this all was true, except my brother-in-law had turned on my stereo for whatever reason. 

so i finish with my dirty deed with no problems. sound never came through the speakers because i tested it beforehand, the monitors were off because i was able to see that there wasn't that blue glow coming out of my door. however, when i finished i didn't turn off the video or exit out of the web. i just accidentally and every so casually pressed the home button. so, there i am, 2 floors away, cum in a paper towel and wiping the excess off my nether region when i casually pressed the button and immediately i knew my mistake. now i knew what could have happened but i was still thinking that i had turned the speakers off and no one turned them back on so i'd still be fine. 

so i waited

two seconds later my speakers two floors up ignited with the sounds of a very nice lady getting absolutely wrecked by some big cock. holy shit. not only did the sound come on but my loud ass studio speaker were turned all the way up and were right next to my bed where my sister an her husband were fast asleep. my neighbors probably thought we were having the loudest orgy ever. my dad freaked. he ran to my room, my brother-in-law was trying to turn the sound off but somehow turned the monitors on in the midst of things. so my dad has now walked in on my sister freaking out, my brother in law trying to unplug every outlet possible and see just some girl getting pounded making the loudest screams i've ever heard. 

needless to say they knew it was me. they knew i did it and they knew it wasn't a joke. i just admitted to jerking it and i was sorry it went through the speakers. they were more mad at the fact that it scared the fucking shit out of everyone because some nice lady just started screaming at 1 in the morning at the loudest setting my speakers had. all in all it was probably the most embarrassing thing that has happened to me and idk about you guys but there is something really embarrassing about anyone seeing what you get off to let alone my parents, sister and brother-in-law. 

 

edit: changed my rude description of a porn star
edit 2: missed a bitch",i woke my whole house up to incredibly loud porn at 1 in the morning which i couldn't stop for a solid 120 seconds. i'll never know any longer time than those 120 seconds.
227,"so i'm on my school's cross country team, nothing big really a lot of conditioning and hard work, and this is my first year doing cross and i was advised by one of the other runners to never drink milk the day of a meet. well i really didn't believe him and today comes around now me wanting to test it out decided to drink a shit ton of milk today. so this morning i ate some cereal and there's milk in that. lunch comes around i drank like 8 pints of chocolate milk (whole other story).

5 comes around and it's time for me to run, i had this feeling in my stomach since like 4:30 i should've listened to it but being a dumbass decided to ignore it. once i took that first stride when the gun went off i knew i made a huge ass mistake. it felt like the shit was going to come out while i was running. to make it all worse the shorts we have to wear are tiny, they are a size large but still are higher than mid-thigh so it felt like the shit was going to come out of the shorts and how was i going to explain that? 

meet ends i got a pretty good time of 21:34 on the 5k and just rush to the porta-potty. now the porta-potty was just plain up disgusting, it smelled like it hasn't been cleaned in years. i sadly added to that horrible smell by taking the wettest shit i have ever taken. it was just so gross that i don't even want to explain it.","read the damn post, it's not that long."
228,"first time telling a story here, so i apologize for any errors.

for the past 2 hours, i've been home alone. no one is in the house except for me. at around 6 pm, i start to feel hungry and because i can't cook food for sh**, i do the next best thing... order pizza. after literally 45 minutes of deciding, i order a papa john's pizza for $10 including shipping. at this point, i'm thinking that this was a sweet deal and move on to do other things. 

about 15 minutes later i feel the urge to use the bathroom ^(poop). *oh, the pizza is supposedly being delivered in around 30 minutes. i'll surely have enough time* i thought. i get in and start doing my thing for 5 freaking minutes until i heard something outside. *it's him.* now i have to explain that the bathroom window is right next to the front porch and i didn't want to embarrass myself so i got up (before wiping my butt) to close the window. desperately, as the man gets closer to the door, i struggle to close the window. but *nope*... my hand slips and it knocks one of my mom's small vases from next to the window; the vase smashes into a trillion pieces. 

quickly getting up (and wiping), i get the money from my desk and pay the man. as soon as i close the door, i hear a knock again. it's him. he tells me that i only gave him $8 instead of the $10+tip. *what the hell?* he shows me all his money and the money i just gave him and apparently he was ""right."" (i can't say he's right since i don't even remember how much money i gave him. i swear i had the correct amount.) i go back and grab an extra $5 and he goes on his way. ugh, i'm now stuck with cleaning up the vase and the bad thoughts of buying the pizza. 

 

edit: eating the pizza right now... it really doesn't taste that good. :( i can say that it was a ""shitty-ass-pizza.""
edit: so it's 2 hours later and i think i found out what happened. the jar i got the money from was missing $14, so this probably means that i mistook one of the dollar bills as a 5. i gave him $14 instead of $13.","i order pizza and use the restroom. delivery man comes 20-30 minutes earlier than expected and i drop a vase. he might have taken an extra $5 but in the heat of the moment, i couldn't remember how much i gave him. stuck with cleaning up a vase and the thought that i may have been cheated.**"
229,"so recently i was browsing reddit and saw someone post how one way to get rid of skin tags is to tie dental floss around them. it cuts off oxygen until it dies basically and falls off.

about a month or 2 ago, i got what i thought was an ingrown hair right on my gooch. i picked at it and it eventually turned into a tiny little skin tag... recently it started to hurt more and more and sex with my boyfriend kept making it worse. we hang out quite a bit so on a day i knew i wouldn't see him i decided to try this dental floss idea. i spent a solid hour just trying to tie it on, and cut the strings shorter once it was on. a few hours later i felt around and didn't feel anything there so i figured the floss fell off and it didn't work. 

as it turns out my boyfriend had to come over that night because he left his car in a place he didn't have access to until the next day. we started fooling around and he starts going down on me then stops all of a sudden. i figured he saw the skin tag and it was maybe irritated or something so i say ""oh if there's anything weird down there it might be the skin tag"". his reply ""babe it's like 2 inches long...""

the dental floss was still there, i just hadn't felt it right. almost died of embarrassment. thankfully he still finished going down on me and we ended off having great sex. he laughed it off and told me i was weird as hell, but it was really funny. luckily we've been together for a few years and he didn't judge me *too* much over it. 

for those curious the next day i realized the floss and the skin tag were gone. **it actually worked!**","tied a piece of floss to my skin tag on my gooch, didn't realize it was still there when boyfriend went down on me and saw it."
230,"background: 1 stick of butter = 1/2 cup. chocolate chip cookies require 1 cup of butter. rice krispy treats require 1/4 cup of butter.

i was craving a nice snack, so i decided to make chocolate chip cookies. the dough was coming out a little funny but i couldn't think why. it wasn't until i was about to bake them that i realized i only put 1 stick of butter into the cookies instead of 2. i doubted that adding more butter at that point could have fixed them, and i didn't have enough anyway. so i had to scrap those cookies.

my sweet tooth is still unsatisfied though. after a quick runthrough of the kitchen, i found that i had just enough ingredients to make a half batch of rice krispy treats. 

hey kids! if the rice krispy treats' recipe calls for 1/4 cup of butter, and butteryasfuck wants to make a half batch, what's the probability that he will forget how to use fractions and doesn't remember to half the butter?

as if i were trying to compensate for putting too little butter in my previous dish, i end up with twice the amount of butter in my next dish. i don't realize until i already melted all of my marshmallows in the buttery disaster. fuck it, i'll have a carrot.","fuck butter, fuck fractions, and fuck fractions of butter."
231,"i just moved last week and today i noticed my furnace pilot light had gone out. after trying to light the pilot per the instructions on the unit with no luck, i decided that it might be dust causing low gas flow. this was a common problem with my old gas stove. so i took out a can of compressed air used for cleaning electronics and blew out much of the dust in the burner area. now i should have let the gas from the duster dissipate or turned the blower on, but instead i just went ahead and tried to light it. wooooshhh!!! giant fireball to the face! i now have first degree burns on my right hand and forearm all the way up to the elbow, plus my eyelids are slightly burnt. in addition, my beard is severely singed and i burnt all the hair off my arm and eyelashes. here are some pics of the lighter i was holding. [http://imgur.com/a/rfj5k](http://imgur.com/a/rfj5k)

btw the pilot is still out.",cleaned furnace with compressed air and tried to light it. fireball ensued.
232,"i'm at a weird stage in my life. i'm 28 and i just moved back to my hometown after quitting my job and moving to a bigger city months ago. long setup short, i figured out that i was leaving fixable problems and i'm kind of a dumbass. i think they call this the quarter-life crisis thingie now? oh, well. i wanted to come home for a multitude of reasons and i did today.

now, my mother came to visit me earlier this week, with the express purpose of riding with me on my return journey. why? i don't fucking know. she's crazy and over-bearing and thought that i would die of a bloodclot in my leg if she wasn't in the car because i would never stop during an 8 hour drive, which doesn't even make sense because i drink a gallon of water a day and pee like 400 times and i'm not an idiot and i like to move around every 3-4 hours and it's not like she came to my white collar job every day for 5 years to ensure that i left my desk every once in a while instead of sitting there for 8 hours straight. plus, she wanted to torture me with her barbra streisand records, thus destroying any possible hopes of an enjoyable road trip, me by myself, in my metal beast/sanctuary.

so my mom is at my apartment and i set her up in my room because she's fucking old and i'm a good kid and even though sleeping on an air mattress combines sleeping on something entirely uncomfortable with sleeping on something that makes noise when you shift around and sleeping on something that you can literally not put fucking sheets on properly, i didn't mind giving up the bedroom for two days. mostly, i wanted to watch justified while she was asleep.

i started the nofap thing as part of my 2013 better me campaign (as i call it). i sorta believe the hype, but whatever, it's more about paying attention to life instead of porn for me. and i wanted the challenge. now, sex is not an issue, but i've had a dry spell throughout this moving process, which has coincidentally lined up with me starting the nofap. i hit day 45 today.

so last night, i hit the old air-bed at around midnight. comfortability being impossible, i finally succumb to the most horrendous slumber ever at 2:45ish. at 4:30 am, i violently awake and realize that something is horribly wrong. i feel some wetness and immediately think back to every time i drink way too much...1) did i wake up while peeing? 2) do i still have pee in me waiting to be evacuated? 3) is it just a little spot? or should i be worried?

the answers to those questions in this case are 1) no. 2). no. 3) fucking worry. 

at this point, wide awake, i start to frantically rip the sheets and blankets off of me, convinced that there's going to be a horse's head somewhere in bed with me. or, an even worse thought, what if this is my own puke or i had some kind of aneurism and bled out in the night? (you may think that's crazy, but one time my tonsils got so swollen, a blood vessel broke in my sleep and i spent hours choking on my own blood and puke...uhh...so there.) what i found was even more unsettling.

cum. cum everywhere. i mean, like a fire hydrant exploded and cum came pouring out. like there was a bukkake party with one guest. there was more cum in my bed than in all 3 kardashians last night. there was so much white in my bed that for a minute i thought i was at a lumineers concert. the way in which my sheets clung to me was not unlike the way manti te'o has clung to his claims of heterosexuality. i mean, there was so much sticky on me last night that snoop dogg might've been interested ('cause of the whole...sticky icky icky...sigh). the point is, there was so much everywhere, that i immediately got up to go redo my whole bed and hose down my stomach, legs and crotchtal area.

that's when i looked at my bedroom door, realizing that i was, in fact, on the outside of my bedroom, which is where my bathroom is...with my sheets and my shower. i mean, i could totally sneak in on my sleeping mother and not wake her up and have to embarrassingly explain why my boxers were soaked, my stomach was glistening and i smelled like fresh sex, right? then i noticed that the light was on under the door crack. my mom cannot fucking sleep regular hours because she's all retired or some shit. fuuuuuuuuuuuck. i was totally ready for my top secret operation: clean my dick without waking mom.

then i had a brilliant idea. my underwear is already packed! but fuck. my underwear is in my car, three flights downstairs, it's 4:45 am, it's below zero degrees and i only have cum-soaked boxers on. this is when i start to get really pissed. not because i realize i'm just gonna toss these boxers and worry about how to hide my nakedness tomorrow morning and thus, avoid questions from my mom like, ""why are you sleeping naked when i'm staying here?"" no. i had just realized that i didn't even remember the dream. i mean...surely, to do this kind of damage (i mean, we are talking about cum dripping off the sides of an air mattress), i probably had a good one going. i don't even have a remnant. i mean, what if i've somehow repressed an orangutan-fucking dream? what if it was the most horrible, dark, depraved act that i didn't even know i could think of? what if that's what gives my dick volcanic eruptions? now i'll never know if i'm into testicle stabbing. maybe it's a good thing that i repressed it. but on the other hand, what if i was like ravaging the most beautiful of all women and then fighting zombies while doing it? seems like those are some images worth storing, brain.

now something else dawns on me. i ruined these shorts, which i had planned to wear on the trip home the next day. i had already packed the rest and didn't want to undo all of my terrific packing! fuck it. bareback kinda day, like that shart at the championship football game a few months earlier. ( edit: shart story available now...http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1azpv8/tifu_by_trusting_a_fart/ )

now i'm like fuck it. i'll peel these bad boys off and just jump back into bed...i'm sure the sheets aren't that bad. wrong. they were. they were still soaked when i woke up 4 hours later. i'm surprised i hadn't somehow spackled the sheets to the ceiling. so now, i'm laying in the stickiest, coldest, wettest, most uncomfortable, fucking bed of all time, with my cum-drenched boxers hidden out of site underneath the bed.

this is when i have another dream and this one i remember and it pisses me off even more. it hadn't dawned on me during my earlier panic that sperm has a particular smell, so much. i mean, usually it's faint, who cares? but when an entire painter's bucket of cum has been dumped on you, you will smell it. it was like seawater and cake batter. it smelled, on the one hand, delicious (hey, that's because it's from me) and on one hand like something that came off of a hobo. so during this nightmare, my entire family was in the room smelling this and i had to play it off like, ""i dunno. what a weird smell. what could that be? certainly not 178 fluid ounces of baby making juice."" eventually, the smell stuck to me and i would have to evade questioning at schools, airports and hospitals. no one ever pinned it on me though.

in the morning, realizing that i was nude and still covered in cum, i pretended to sleep until i saw my opening...my mom went out for a cigarette, i showered and threw everything in the washing machine.

shit worked out. but goddamn. a nocturnal emission at 28 years old is not pleasant in the least bit.

 

edit:  too much shame for my real account. this is my throwaway. thought i should explain that in case you see my 0 karma.","28-year old staying with mom for the night had a wet dream, most epic amount of cum ever. had to sleep in naked shame without access to clean clothes or shower. like, so much sperm for real. like...i couldn't even pee this much cum if pee were cum."
233,"**background info:** in religion studies (a compulsory subject at my school) some idiot was supposedly having a spasm and said he was having an orgasm, not knowing the difference.

so i was on my commute home from school talking to my girlfriend about how school was (we're in different grades) and i started telling her what happened in religion. i tell her about the horrible mistake the kid made and it ended up turning into a mistake of my own. everybody went silent and stared at me. my sister was there too, and it was all she was talking about to me on the ~100m walk from the bus stop home.

i'm an idiot.","told girlfriend someone said orgasm in my religion class on the bus, everybody stared at me"
234,"so i am making the road trip back home after my second semester. i hadn't eaten since around 9 am central time, it was now 6 pm mountain time. i enter the convenience store, here begins our story down to fuckupville.

i walk over to the counter and place the items i have decided to purchase, fuck up number one, convenience store pizza, i was starved. fuck up number two, trying to counteract said pizza with the healthy choice of cantaloupe melon and not properly reading the label, more on that later. and fuck up number three, thinking that sweet tea and milk were a good idea combination to wash it all down. (mildly lactose intolerant, but it hasn't bothered me in months)

we get about 15 minutes down the road, i've downed the pizza and milk and now it's dessert time. i take a bite out of the cantaloupe and think, this tastes weird... i flip the label up, fucking high fructose corn syrup is the third ingredient. immediately i stop, high fructose fucking corn syrup. being an idiot i continued to eat the shit. it tastes funny still but i am chalking it up to the hfcs.

now we are two more hours down the road from that, the pizza and milk are battling it out, nothing out of the norm, just my mind racing hoping i don't end up unlucky and shitting myself to end up on tifu.

the addition of this bad cantaloupe added a new level to the gurgles, levels i had never felt before in my entire life. the sugar content of the tea and the nasty 'loupe seemed to combine to create nauseating waves of pure rancid nastiness. i am thinking to myself, please esophagus, don't get shorter, do not make me spill this all over the inside of this car.

unfortunately, this is why i am here, i screamed as my esophagus shrunk, pull the fucking car over. and right before it stopped i spewed inside the door, pooling it in the door pockets. i projectile vomit into the new mexico wilderness. within two minutes, it was all over. my nausea was gone and i felt good. until i looked back at the car.

apparently busting a gut inside the car caused my mother and sister to vomit as well, i will be trying to clean off my luggage for the rest of the night..","don't fucking eat convenience store cantaloupe, ever**"
235,"so i get into the shower like on every normal morning, usually spend five minutes. however, today the soap/shampoo i usually use isn't there. aside from that, we have face scrub and this bottle of irish spring.

now, being me, not only am i tired as balls, but i also do not turn on the light. i cannot see what this soap is, and haven't seen it before because i don't look where it was, ever. i assume that it is normal irish spring, knowing that we've had that before.

nope. i lather the shit onto everything including my crotch, and just let me tell you, when a soap says ""electrify,"" it means fucking business. this shit is the hot pepper equivalent of soap. i try my best to stop the electrification, but nothing fucking works. water would not sooth it, covering it would not sooth it, and a handfull of face scrub would not sooth it. my five minute in-and-out shower easily became a ten minute sit-there-holding-dick-and-balls-as-if-they-will-fall-off shower.

needless to say i used face scrub until there was a charge neutral soap.",my entire crotch is shocked by soap.
236,"so, basically i'm a little boy trapped in the body of a hairy mountain of a man. what is a popular thing for little boys to do? well, build potato cannons, obviously. but since i have a job, i can afford to make my cannon a bit more... *industrial.* this includes a [push-button barbecue igniter](http://www.spudfiles.com/forums/files/ig2_636.jpg) to light it off, because only peasants light their spud guns with lantern lighters. 

so i got the parts after work today with the intent to assemble them some time in the next few days, or over the weekend at least. being the little boy that i am, i decided to start screwing around with the piezo sparker that i bought. so i have the electrode and the wires hooked up, and for some reason i can't get it to spark. so i'm sitting there, clicking away at the button, messing with the gap in the wires, etc. all of a sudden, i realize something - every time i press the button, i get a twinge and sharp pain in my fingers. not much, but it's there. so what do i do? maybe, stop pressing the button? nope. just keep on absentmindedly clicking away, repeatedly shocking my hand, which is numb at this point. eventually i realized that my hand position was what was causing the current to jump across my hand. i am a fucking retard.

237,"tifu, i bought my first bottle of wine since i'm celebrating finishing college and wanted to upgrade from my usual boxed variety or beer. unfortunately, i have never used a corkscrew and only managed to remove the cork half-way. instead of re-trying the corkscrew, i decided to try to pry out the cork using a knitting-needle. when that didn't work, and, in fact, i only succeeded in breaking off the protruding part of the cork, i had another burst of inspiration: if i couldn't pry the cork out, why couldn't i just push it in? so, i flipped around the knitting-needle and pushed...with a loud chunk and a splash of wine in my face, the bottle was open! when i filled my glass, however, the glow of my success faded: the wine was filled with particles of cork. gross! so, i don't know how to open a bottle of wine, and i wasted my money, time, and energy, and i didn't even get the fruits of my labor. c'est la vie...","i can't use a corkscrew, ended up pushing the cork into the bottle of wine, and then couldn't drink it because of the bits of cork floating about."
238,"backstory: i'm working at a summer camp with very few employees (about 20). my roommate is a super nice guy whom i didn't know until this summer. i was gardening with a good friend of mine, and we started talking.

my friend commented that no other two workers at the camp would have been as productive as us. we were working hard. this somehow led me to talking about my roommate, whose name i used, saying that he is not the best worker sometimes. i continued to mention how he wasn't the best volleyball player, as we played volleyball last night and he cost our team a few points. 

we hear a greeting, and turn around to see the head gardener and my roommate. it was the gardener who had said hello. they had just driven up on a card with a fairly loud engine, though i hadn't heard it approaching, so i'm not sure how much was heard. i can only assume that my roommate heard it all. whether he did or not, i feel absolutely terrible and will be apologizing to him as soon as i see him next.

my fear is that this is a very small, close-knit community where word spreads quick. i feel like a complete asshole for this situation and would honestly deserve it if everyone found out. i just want to at least sincerely apologize to my roommate. i know this isn't quite as exciting or terrible as a lot of tifus, i just had to get it off of my chest.

on a side note, my roommate may not be the best at manual labor, but he is a great event planner and organizer. 

this whole ordeal is going to change the way i talk (and think) about others.",my roommate overheard me talking about how i don't think he's a great worker.
239,"i'll apologize in advance for lack of formatting and whatnot, as i'm typing this on my phone.


i bought a sony vaio e series back in march that was suppose to come with sony imagination studio programs. i came to find that it in fact does not have these programs. went to the store and they said to call sony.


i googled the number for sony customer service. this one came up that said sony vaio tech service. i thought it was a direct line to the customer tech support. fuck was i wrong. (though let me clarify, i asked if it was sony vaio tech support and dude says yes, of course) 


let this hindu guy on my computer via help44.com. i was thinking ""okay dude has to verify that the programs actually aren't there."" he proceeds to show me all these viruses and trojans that are in my system,that he put there!!! 


he then proceeds to tell me that my antivirus is doing nothing and  wants to charge me to remove these viruses from my computer. i only realized my mistake once i was off the phone with this guy. (like the fact that he put the viruses on there)

computer is fucked at this point. in a complete state of panic. fuck my $780 computer that is only 3 months old is fucked. my husband kept his cool and called the real sony customer tech support. they talked us through restoring our computer. everything is backed up on our external hard drive so no lost files there. restoration is in progress but we aren't out of the woods yet. holy fuck i hope my pc is salvageable.

240,"let me start by establishing, i'm not a smart person.

 after a great day at the mall with my sister, we decided to end our trip with some 25 cent candy. my sister immediately went for a handful of m&amp;m's, while i took more time deciding on my treat. gumball? no, skittles? maybe, jaw breakers? nah. then i saw them. crybabies! the ultimate in sour experience. 

i placed my last quarter (after starting the trip with over sixty dollars) into the beloved machine. with joy, i turned the handle and was rewarded with a large handful of sour candies. as i placed the first one in my mouth hole, a slight moment of germ-a-phobia was brought on. who had touched this candy? who had touched that machine? as soon as it was on my tongue though, i couldn't have cared less. this candy was delicious. 

as the flavor was dissolved, my taste-buds were greeted with a tangy, mouth twisting sour. my lips pursed, my eyes watering. this was the sourest thing i've put into my mouth in a long time. (let's note that i tend to eat sour things on a regular bases) after that was gone, i proceeded to eat another. 

that's when the idea hit me. what would happen, if i were to eat them all at once? ""no, oogieboogie1996!"" my subconscious said, ""savor them!"" screw that, i thought, shoveling the handful of candies into my mouth. 

hey, not bad! this is actually o-oh my sweet'n'sour! the candy burst with extreme sour with every bite. this was defiantly not what i had expected. i am now walking through the crowded mall, my face twisted in anguish, while my sister laughs her a-s-s off. 

as we neared a trash can, i wagered to spit them all out. no! i could do this. i spent my last quarter on this candy, i'm going to finish it! with mouth-firing fury, the candy made it's grand finally. but, before it did that, it left a good sized sore in the back of my mouth. now, my candy is gone and i still have several minutes to wait before our ride home showed up. 

now, let's stop for a moment and take stock. 

can we feel our teeth? no. 

can we feel our tongue? barley. 

how's that new sore? painful. 

sister laughing? yes. 

is she mocking you? oohh yeah. 

on a scale of one to ten, how bad do we need a drink? 10000 1/2. 

i proceed to pull the remainders of the water bottle i had brought, out of my bag. finally, some relief! nope. the bottle was empty. my sister had took the last of it and put the bottle bag in my bag. skunk bag. now what? is it too much to hope that our pick up had brought a drink? apparently it was, because she didn't. now, i've got a sore in my mouth and a broken spirit towards the candy i love. 

 

edit: bro, do you even grammar?","never, ever, put a pile of sour crybabies in your mouth at the same time. just don't do it man."
241,"throwaway~
my roommate was out doing stuff with their family and i was washing my laundry with nothing clean to wear, and having just got out of the shower and dried myself i wanted to play some video games.  i fired up the tv and started playing a game thinking that my roommate would be gone all day and wouldn't have to walk in on me.  i underestimated the time they would be gone.

my roommate is a horrible germophobe and they walked in on me stark naked in the living room on the couch.  awkward stare.   i pointed outside and they went back out.  i ran to my room and yelled them back inside.   

they had me clean the couch and now i'm lying in my room feeling the most horrible i can possibly feel posting to reddit.  i guess this is one way to relieve some pressure.


 

edit: life continues on as normal, as if nothing happened.  though, i did clean the entire apartment to take my mind off everything.","germophone roommate was away, sat on the couch naked after shower and they walked in on me.  total and horrible awkwardness ensued."
242,"i have a summer job working with insects in a lab. i do a lot of repetitive lab technician type work that includes changing the foliage (i.e. bug food) we have in a bunch of these modified plastic slushie cups that we've turned into cages, each with a pair of insects in them that we're mating. 

before we can actually take the old foliage out of the cup and put the fresh stuff in, we need to take the insects out and put them in a different cage so that they don't escape while we're changing stuff over. these bugs actually hold onto leaves surprisingly tight and its always a bit of a balance between pulling hard enough to get them off the old leaves and into the new cage while making sure that you don't just squish them with your tweezers.

anyways, i'm mindlessly picking bugs out of cups and putting them into other cups when i come across this one insect that is holding onto this leaf strangely tighter than usual. after 30 seconds or so of trying to gently pick this insect off with my tweezers i get frustrated and give it a good hard pull, right as i realize that it isnt holding onto a leaf, its holding onto another insect, mating.

well it came off allright, with it's dick still attached to the female and no longer attached to it's body. 

i mean, it's only an insect, but i still felt pretty bad about it. 

 

update: it died. natural causes i assume.

no, i dont have pictures of the bugs dick. i did [take some pictures](http://imgur.com/a/qkzhy) of a couple of the other bugs though, in case anyone is curious

holy shit fuck up of the week? wow.","accidentally pull two mating insects apart, the male's penis gets ripped off in the process and is left hanging out of the female. i feel pretty bad about the whole thing."
243,"i went to 7elven to get smokes and an ice coffee, no big deal. except i was kinda high which made me paranoid and kinda clumsy. 

so i'm standing at the ice coffee machine beside a guy and his maybe 12 year old son while they get big gulps. me being the stoned idiot i am, i start the flow of deliciousness into my plastic cup with out adding ice. 

it seemed like an okay idea to just add the ice after. i mean, what could go wrong. 

i pushed the cup against the ice release and all hell breaks loose. ice coffee everywhere. including the kid standing right beside me. 

the guy turned around and said ""seriously?!"". all i could muster was ""oh god i'm so sorry!"".


i felt so terrible. then i had to stand behind them in line. he shot me a look that made me feel an inch tall.",i spilled ice coffee all over a little boy and his father shamed me with just a look.
244,"today started out like any other day. i woke up, made myself bacon and eggs on a bagel, and called up a buddy to chill. we decided we wanted to go rock climbing, so i grabbed my gear and made my way to pick him up.

forces of the universe were clearly against us going climbing together. pulled over for speeding, turns out the cop's radar gun was wonky. dumbasses driving brought traffic to a slow crawl. to top it all off, a bird flew into my windshield, scaring the shit out of me, almost causing me to drive myself into a ditch(jumping made me jerk the wheel).

but i made it to his house. he gets in and we shoved off towards my special spot i've fallen in love with. we make the hike in and had an amazing day climbing. i got him to attempt an overhang, and i crushed a route that's harder than i'm used to (on the yosemite decimal system, i tend to climb 5.10c to 5.11c. i crushed a 5.12b). we called it good and decided we wanted to go to a beach and chill before sundown.

along our hike out, there is a tent set up, some woman walks out buckass naked, she screams, and a midget runs(his member standing at full attention) out of the tent wielding a knife that was longer than his forearm. he screamed at my buddy and i to the effect of ""if you tell her husband, i will find you, i will slit your throats, and then fuck the new hole"". ive never met this woman in my life.

we skipped the beach and just drove to his house.","woke up, a bird kamikaze'd, i went climbing, then got threatened by a midget.**"
245,"well not today, but more like a year ago.... hell you don't care.

so i used to have a huge fear of the dark when i was 14. no biggy right? wrong!

 i have a decent group of friends that skate like me and one of them asked me over to hang out. ended up staying over but didn't bring anything to sleep in so i asked him for some sleep shorts.

well it was all fine and dandy till it was 2 in the morning and everyone was asleep.

i had to piss.

 now my greatest fear is trying to find the bathroom in a friends house in the middle of the night, but at the time i was to scared to so i decided to piss right there in the shorts he gave me. so there i am 14 scared of the dark with my snoring friend one bump in the night away from seeing me urinating all over his basketball shorts. i almost cried. luckily i maned(?) up and fixed it by (while peeing) by taking the shorts off and using them or suck up all the pee. i put on my jeans and went to the bathroom. threw the shorts in the bathroom trash can and set out to his room to lay back down and hope it all goes smooth in the morning.

it did and we had eggs. i still slightly smelled of but covered it up with axe bodyspray(we were 14). 

i have grown [alot](http://reddit.com/r/alot) since then and have been invited to his house many of times and it had gone off without a hitch.",was to pussy to go upstairs to my friends bathroom so instead pissed on the shorts he gave me but did clean i up.
246,"i go on walks, long walks. during these walks i always bring a water bottle, or two, and drink constantly. now usually this isn't a problem, but today i felt adventurous and decided to walk all way to the other side of my neighborhood. no problem, i've done it thousands of times. just not with a full bladder. 

now i should start here, seeing as i was fine until this point. i walked past a mcdonalds and thought ""gee, maybe i should go to the bathroom now"". but no. i was stupid and didn't. i kept on walking. now there's two parts to this other side. the stores and places, and the residential area. of course i had to piss like never before just as i got to the area with houses upon houses. 

i  really had to go, all of a sudden, and i debated whether or not to just pull my zipper down and go near a bush. but the people who live in this part are hoity toity rich assholes, who already called the cops on me once last year, and i didn't feel like it was a good idea. so i put my head down and just started hauling ass. of course, when you have to piss, or crap, walking faster just makes it feel all the more uncomfortable. so i kept having to slow down, speed up, slow down..and this isn't a short walk. i contemplated just pissing in my pants but i was wearing denim, which would show everything. so i just kept hauling ass, and praying i make it. 

this goes on a long time, feels like an eternity. i finally get to my side, the other side, but of course this comedy of errors is far from over. i manage to get stuck behind a guy with bowl legs, a caravan of high school kids, a wheelchair, and just slow ass people. i'm going full speed at this point, bobbing, weaving, cutting off women with strollers (sorry). fucking finally i get to the place of pissing, a barnes and noble. i run in like a swarm of bees is on my ass, and get to the escalator. my luck it's off. i gotta walk it. at this point my bladder is screaming at me, and it hurts to even walk. i get up, barely, and run towards the bathroom. every other time i come here to piss it's empty. today it's all but full. i don't give a shit if these people get splashed or something, i gotta go. i get to the urinal, and just explode on it. i'm standing there peeing and some guy is standing right behind me coughing on my leg. how he is directing the cough that way, i don't even know. but i didn't care at this point. i finish, wash my hands, walk out, and immediately think this is going on /r/tifu.",trust your bladder. seriously.
247,"a little backstory - my grandfather passed away a year ago, leaving a car behind. the deal was then that provided i would drive my little sister to and from school every day, i could use the car untill i moved out of the house. i was 18 at the time and had just gotten my driver licence, so this was a sweet deal.

fast forward two years, i have now moved away, so the time came to give back the car. my perent's planned on selling it since i didn't need it anymore. so in order for it to be nice and shiny, i decided to wash it.

having limited supplies (i only juuuust moved in) i decided to just use a washcloth and some soap. but since the front end had some grime on it that i could not get off, my brain turns off and i decided to use a scourer. you can imagine the outcome. i feel like a moron.",: scourer+car=unhappy perents
248,"so, i'm going to preface this story by explaining to you some things about my room. the latch to my door from the main hallway is very tricky. you have to push that nob in the center at just the right angle while the door is being pushed shut to squeeze the door in close to align the latching mechanism. my and my dad recently moved to this house, but i've been here for a few months now and i've gotten the trick of it, most of the time. also in the room, is a second door leading outside the house. i should also mention that i use that second door to exhale my smoke from my legal weed grown in wa.

this day of all days, my dad was having some family friends over to show the house to. i had just come home from the gym, said a quick 'hi', and hopped in the shower. i had met these friends before, and they were alright, but not worth my time when i could be playing some borderlands 2, high. i planned i would simply chat with all them for a quick few minutes after showering and smoking (it had to be right then, because the post-gym blaze is just amazing). so i got my bong ready to go, just when i heard them coming down the stairs to the floor my room is on. but i thought 'oh, i totally locked the door because i just took a shower and i'm naked right now'. i decided to not double check the lock, and continue with my bong hit. so i hit my bong, and then turned to open the door to the outside of my house. as soon as i pushed it open, the suction from the air pressure change pulled open my unlatched door, revealing a naked me with a milked bong around my mouth to my father,and the johnson family. i made i contact.","today i fucked up by not making sure my door was latched while taking a naked bong rip, and being unfortunately revealed by the laws of physics"
249,"so, here's the deal.

i'll make this as short as possible. i don't want to talk about it.

i'm good friends with my ex's brother.

we hang out a lot and play guitar. he's a cool guy.

now, his friend tried to kill herself yesterday.

i give this whole speech about how she's gonna make it and everything.

he cheers up.

he gets the news! she made it! :d

so we're writing our exam the next day and we both finish writing. we hand them in and jam the electric for a bit. (i'm not a good guitarist. i was attempting to play *nirvana - smells like teen spirit* and failing.) and as he takes out his acoustic, i turn to him and say this.

""oh by the way, i told you she'd make it, motherfucker!"" 

we laugh, we talk, we play some songs. it was pretty awesome.

she died 11 hours later.","my friend's buddy tried to kill herself. she made it, i bragged about how i knew she would, then she died."
250,"so tifu, well technically yesterday. so i am a male, as the username implies. however due to poor planning i ended up in a history class that focuses on women. as you would expect the teacher is a hard core feminist, and i am one of like three guys in the entire class. the teacher let’s call her ms. s is always complaining how men ruin everything in history; how hernán cortés was an awful person because he was a guy. disregard the massacring of civilizations just because he is a guy is the reason he is awful. the entire semester my teacher talks about how all guys in history want to do is have sex and that is the motives all guys have. 

despite all this, ms. s has one nice rule and that is if you have a 90% in the class you don’t not need to take her final. so my every last assignment before finals my teacher gave me a c on assignment putting me at an 88%. i figure it must be a mistake and that’ll i’ll just go to her office hours to change it.

so i head off to school early to go to my teachers office hours. as i am walking across the quad my university is having a std fair. as i am making my way through the fair one of my friends runs up and puts a sandwich bags worth of condoms in my backpack. (you know not the ziplock ones but the ones that don’t have any way of staying shut). i talk to my friend then proceed to my feminist teacher’s office hours.

 i plead my case for getting a better grade. she tells me to come in on monday at a certain time to remind her i am not taking the final. i go to reach for a paper and pencil to write down the times. as i go to get them i accidently pull out the bag of condoms with the rest of my stuff. the condoms at least 10 of them spill onto the ground of her office. 

now a more suave person would have made a joke or played it off. well not me i immediately panic, put away the paper and pencil, zip up backpack, and without saying another word, walk out of her office. so i think it is a safe assumption that i am going to need to take the final in her class now.

  

edit i realized i’m illiterate as all hell.",spilled condoms on my teachers carpet makes me take a final in her class.
251,"so i'm visiting my grandparents and uncle today for a sort of nice family get-together. they live downtown in a fairly small appartment; about 3 rooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom. 
the problem is, i had eaten two entire buckets of extremely spicey buffalo wild wings, and had to drop a massive care package about an hour into the visit. i saw that the bathroom was very close to the dining room, in which we were all sitting and enjoying some nice apple pie. i planned on holding it until after the meal, but the oncoming storm of chocolate rain refused to be held back. 
i excuse myself from the table and sit on the can. not a second later the brown waterfall begins splashing into the water, accompanied by sounds which i never thought my stimach would be capable of making. this continued for roughly 25 minutes, with short pauses in between the torrential shitstorms. i could hear the sounds of fidgeting and discomfort coming from the other room, and by the end i felt embarrassed but extremely relieved. 
i am currently sitting in the living room and trying to make conversation, after having to clean my watery shit off of the inside of the toilet as the water could only take down at most 1/3 of it. 

but the moral of the story is, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.",my grandparents had to listen to me shit a mountain after eating buffalo wild wings the day before.
252,"so, this actually happened a few years ago, but i was reminded of it by reading another tifu post and thought is was worthy of this sub...
i was a college freshman at the time, and was leaving a marching band rehearsal when my car broke down. i managed to limp it to a gas station where i used a payphone to call for a ride (this was back in the dark ages, when not many people carried cell phones, and cell phones looked like today's cordless home phones.  guess that dates me...). while i was waiting, i sat down on the curb and lit a cigarette. as i was finishing up, i noticed a pair of extremely attractive coeds jogging past. being a typical 18-year-old mess of hormones and perversion, i was paying much more attention to all that mobile t&a than i was to what i was doing. long story short, instead of grinding my cig out on the curb like i meant to, i instead stubbed it out on my bare knee. the scream could be heard for miles. the girls turned, saw me, died laughing, and i got a nice little burn scar on my leg that i still bare today.",i chose boobs over brains and used my leg for an ashtray.
253,"so there i am, looking to impress the little four year old i'm babysitting.  i get up to the diving board, and i plan on doing a front flip like i have performed a million times.  but alas, today is no normal day my friends, for fate had another idea in mind.  i load up, and take a mighty leap into the water. and just for a little back story, i am a very athletically built man, 6'3"" and 220 lbs. i absolutely nailed the front flip.  i come out of the water, turn around, and the diving board is just floating in the pool.  i motherfucken' launched the diving board out of the ground and into the pool.  i am immediately followed with grief for i totally destroyed it, and i look at the kid i am babysitting and all he can muster to say through his tears is, ""it's your fault! your too fat and you broke it!"" luckily, when the mom got home she was okay with it and knew it was an accident, but i still can't help to feel absolutely horrible about it.","my fat ass decided to do a flip, flipped the diving board itself."
254,"me narrating this post for those with reading difficulties - sorry that it's rushed, but any longer and it wouldn't let me upload: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0tsu21lrg8o

first off: this didn't happen today, it happened last friday, and it wasn't me, it was a co-worker; i thought it'd be ok to post though as i doubt he's a redditor.

we work in one of the world's most popular pizza restaurants and i, along with my co-workers are back-of-house workers.  there were three back-of-house workers that night: myself; johnny (gas-stop guy) and; sean (working his last shift).

so it's friday at 8pm (we stop-serving at 9pm) and cleaning duties are well under way.  one such duty is to remove each holding pot of pizza toppings, so it's clean for the next day.

well, as i was doing so, there was a trolley behind me, at the entrance of the oven (note: the oven has three-tiers, each with a conveyor belt, so you get standardised cooking time for all pizzas).  my co-worker (sean) leaves the spray bottle on the trolley, and knocks the fuckin' thing off the trolley, on to the middle-rack of the 400°c/752°f oven. 

nobody notices, of course, and it rolls along the conveyor belt straight into the oven.  now, the third back-of-house worker (johnny) is running between making and cutting pizzas, and as he approaches me we hear a **boom!** our hearts stop and we stare at each-other for a second like: ""ack fuck, what did that eejit do now?""

we turn around and, sure enough there are fucking flames shooting out of both the entrance and exit of the oven: i freeze, johnny hits the 'emergency stop gas' button, and, as i turn around, the turkish front-of-house worker has a bloody fire extinguisher in his arms:

""how do i use this?!"", he says, whilst fumbling around.

""i don't know!  pull the cord!""

he does so, and extinguishes the flames on both sides (although, apparently he was using the 'wrong' type of extinguisher).

by this point there's a smoke alarm going off, no gas, and the customers are all half-afraid and bewildered at what-the-fuck is going on.

we haven't worked out what caused the fire by this stage, so we're all just half-shocked/relieved that the episode's over.  hahaha, i forgot to say, the manager was on the shitter when this happened so out-she-comes wondering what all the commotion is.

we evacuate, just as security comes (this is a shopping centre we work in) and they start yelling at us for not evacuating earlier - cunts.

when we get back inside, we see the crumpled/exploded remains of the spray bottle and realise what happened.

oh, and as an additional fuck-up: the following day johnny (who jumped into action with the gas-stop button) re-enacted it to other colleagues... and hit the fuckin' button again, causing us to have no gas for 30 minutes, and the security to chase up and shout at us again.","co-worker wanted to leave with a bang - that he did, that he certainly did."
255,"so after a very long period of planning today is the day i was going to plan a flight to amsterdam for my friends an i.

we all planned on sorting the flights and passport details at around 8. there's 6 of us and only 2 actually answered the phone. i finally get around to do the last 2 and they both have double barrel names, its now 11pm and im getting tired. so of course i completely forgot and only put down their last name.

it took me a good hour to realise what had happenned and now ive got to change both of their names on the flight tickets. costing £70 each. im £140 out of pocket and the flights only cost £50.

im hoping to god the easyjet gods smile upon me tomorrow when i ring customer support.",have to pay an extra £140 on top of a £50 flight because im an idiot.

today, after my break i talked with hr, which is actually pretty much just one guy. he was really nice and kinda understood that it was just a dumb mistake, but he told me that the guy who exclaimed ""who the fuck is titler?""'s dad had been some freedom fighter in ww2 and was really offended. the upper management guy was worried that i was a neo-nazi or something like that. other than that, he told me not to use my personal computer at work. i got a warning, and that is all.

my co-workers is now calling me titler and is joking how i ""burn"" (for the lack of a better word) off when they call for help.",titler won the war.
257,"in one of my classes, (community college) we had a take home exam, and i swear that in the email that had the questions and in class my professor said it was due at 2:30 (or anytime from 2:30 to 3:45) on tuesday. i get to class at 3, after doing some double checking of my answers, only to find that my professor's door was not only closed & locked, but had the light off. i freaked out, paced around and walked around the building a couple of times looking for my professor, assuming that he had to be at school still on an exam day. 

no luck. i email him, explaining the situation and asking if there is anything i can do. at this point, i'm just praying he doesn't give me a zero. i have a great chance of making an a in the class, and if i got a zero on the final i did for hours, i would not only be devastated, but likely would not get into any 4 year school because of the likely gpa drop-off.

for 20 minutes i was just refreshing my email. no answer. i then go to re-read the email he sent out of the exam, only to find out our exam isn't until thursday. i didn't know what to think, and didn't feel instant relief. i just sat there thinking ""hm, that just happened"". so i leave to go work out, knowing i have no purpose being at school anymore, and am just feeling like an absolute idiot emailing him begging for his mercy for me being late to turn in the exam. so the whole drive to the gym all i can think about is how stupid he must think i am.

fast forward to 6 and a half hours later. at 9:30 i email him saying ""hi professor ___, please disregard my last email as i misread the due date. with that being said, i plan on investing in a calendar."" 

he responds in 5 minutes, and not only did he never get the original email of me begging for mercy, but he did not find my joke funny. i also could have sworn that i sent both emails to everyone in my class, which would have been a downright nightmare. luckily, the disaster was avoided.",i am illiterate
258,"this was last night, but i went ahead and posted it anyways.

so it was valentines day. my friend invited me over for valentines dinner, because she and i both have long distance relationships. let me just note here, that her parents don't know that she's having anybody over while they're out of town, and the same goes for her older brother. well, here's what happened.

i arrive at her house at about 4 o'clock, and we're having a grand time talking and cooking fettuccini alfredo (omnomnom.) and then we have dinner and chill for a while. little did we know that her older brother was going to be throwing a house party that night with his girlfriend.


so at around 8:30, her brother gets home with his girlfriend. (10/10 would smash) he tells us to get out, that he's having a party. we decide to just go up to her room and hang out there for a while. an hour later, shit got crazy.

there's loud music blasting (they live in the middle of the country, hardly any neighbors), people vandalizing the walls and furniture, and people fighting. we emerge from her room after a couple was banging on her door, demanding the room for themselves so they could fornicate. so we went out of her room to go check out how 'awesome' this party was.. the whole house was trashed. vandalism on the walls, vases broken, as well as her cabinets smashed in. there were a good 100-150 people there (it's a huge house.) and we tried to get out. there were people playing around with lighters and axe, screwing around with the cat, and most of all, drinking too much. about every corner you turned there was someone either passed out, or puking. let's just say the whole thing was a clusterfuck. 

anyways to cut to the chase, her parents ended up getting home early from their week long vacation, a day early. coincidentally, my friend and i were walking out of the house right as her parents pulled up. my parents got called, she's grounded for a month, and her brother has to pay for all of the damages done to the house.","i went to my friend's house for dinner, her brother threw a wicked party while her parents weren't home, house got trashed, and i was involved because we didn't leave early enough."
259,"i recently moved away from this town i had lived in for a few years, and before i moved i decided i wanted to spend one final movie night with this girl who i had a major crush on. 

so she comes over to my house and we are having a great time (at least i thought so) and i try to kiss her. she freaks out, jumps up, grabs her phone and basically says ""that's not what i want out of this,"" then she quickly tells me that she hopes i like my new town, and runs out. now i've moved thousands of miles away and i don't know if i'll ever see her again. i've sent her a few texts, but all she replies back with are your standard fare ""okays,"" and ""i sees."" i don't know what to do next.

sorry this wasn't funny, i just don't know what else to do but rant on the internet.","tried to kiss a girl before i moved away, and she ran out on me."
260,"ok so it was tuesday but that doesn't matter, there was a soccer tornament on monday and everyone was tired so i offered to hook up my laptop. it just so happened that the only movie i had was starship troopers, so it came to the communal shower scene and the vice principal walked in he jumped the immediate conclusion that it was a porno and immediately took my computer. later i got called down to the office and luckily the principal was who we expland to (it's. a small school so the principal knows everyone and is very understanding) but the vp nearly got him fired and suspended me on the spot.","we watched starship troppers, the vp thought it was a porno and nearly fired the teacher and suspended me."
261,"to start off - i hate my job and find this hilarious. i've told my dad and best friend so far and they both think this is a joke and are telling me to quit since i don't like working there anyway.

ok - so i work for a decent sized building, and i have a friend (let's call her amy) in the groundskeepers office that has a few of the higher up managers in that area. my friend is one of the secretaries in that office and her desk is a bit out in the open. last night - the door to the office area was open because it was being cleaned by a custodian so i put 2 and 2 together and came up with my little prank, and saran wrapped her chair.

the next morning, i get a text from amy who is not at work because her dad had a stroke asking me if i did something to her chair because all 3 of her managers are angry. so i was like... oh... alright. i'll let them know who did it and take responsibility for it - no problem. the fix is like 1 minute with a set of scissors, so i don't know what the big deal is... so i emailed one of her bosses (the more chill of the 3) and let him know that i did it, i'm sorry, won't happen again and here is my managers contact info yadda yadda.

he requests me to call him. we talk a bit and he said he thought they were given a new chair or that someone played a little joke and played it off, but the other manager did not take it so light...

he then informs me that the issue was sent to security by the hardass manager of the three in that office. he apparently was livid and contacted security to video mine to see who had done it because it was a ""breach of security"", and i should not have been inside. there is picture and video evidence of my saran wrapping the fuck out of her chair (nothing else, i didn't disturb or take anything while i was there), and it has already been escalated to hr. my manager probably knows about it now, but i am off today and have not seen any emails yet.

not only that, but that the custodian who propped the door open is also going to get spoken to for ""letting me in"", when she actually mentioned it to her manager and did what she was supposed to. i'll add that the custodian manager looked me in the eye, saw what i was doing, laughed, and said ""don't worry about it, just leave him alone"" and kept walking.

so ~4 years working it possibly about to vanish because someone who makes 10x my salary has no sense of humor at all. i almost hope that they do fire me because i think this will be a great story later in life... i would pay money in order to be able to tell the story about how i got fired for saran wrapping a chair, as well as be able to point out the fact that the place i work at is getting... well... silly.

 

edit - spelling",if i get fired for saran wrapping my co-workers chair. i am putting that shit in bold on my resume'.
262,"so me and my ex (we will call her laura) broke up almost a year ago after being together for 6 months. the break up was pretty smooth and consequently we have remained friends since. 

well today i was on my way to the bus station after i finished college to start my hour long journey home. i am almost there when i get a phone call from laura saying that she is on the car park near the bus station having just dropped off (we shall call him roger) and could give me a lift home. me being the lazy half human, half sloth that i am agreed instantly as it meant i not only saved money but it also meant that i would be home 45 minutes sooner than normal which was great news as i knew my laptop had been returned after being gone for 2 weeks getting repaired. 

so i haul ass and get to the car park where laura is waiting for me and i get in to the passenger seat (this is where the fuck up begins) and thank her for giving me a lift as my house is in completely the opposite direction to hers. 

i causally start a conversation with the normal ""how are you?"" ""what have you being up to?"" crap that would normally fill up the quick 15 minute drive home. laura mentions how the night before she had being out drinking with roger and a group of lads, so me being the inquisitive fuck that i am jokingly said ""oh cool, so are you getting slammed by any of them?"" to which she didn't reply, she just had a slight smirk on her face indicating to me that she was indeed, getting slammed by one of them. this didn't bother me, like i said earlier our break up was smooth and neither of us longer liked each other in that way anymore, however, i then proceeded to quiz further in to the dark hole of self hatred that was to come. 

it turns out that laura and roger where friends with benefits and prior to picking me up had being 'going to town' in her small car... on the seat... i was now sat in. laura then decided to go in to great detail about how her and roger where doing it so hard that the seat got covered in all sorts of human baby making love juices. at this point i had to hold in a mouthful of sick as i realized i had not looked at the seat as i sat down. 

we arrive at the small town i live in. i feel like the journey has lasted for hours... almost days as my mind has run back to back images of what horrific deeds had happened in the seat i was sat in just minutes before i sat there. 

we pull up at my house and i grateful beyond belief that my time in this tiny brothel of a car is over... yet there is worse was to come... i go to leave the car and she grabs my hand. i turn to look and as i do she kisses me on the cheek. this normally would not of bothered me, but this time was different... different because she has just spent the last 15 minutes telling me about how she and roger did everything and how he apparently came in her mouth after she sucked him off... i could feel rogers white super solider swimming across my face. i quickly said bye and ran to my house. 

now i am here... staring blankly in to my monitor after sitting in the shower for an hour and half. i feel violated... dirty almost. 

today i fucked up, resulting in me having another mans cum indirectly placed on my face.",got a lift home with my ex after she had hardcore fucked a man ending with him filling her up with his man protein to only have her kiss me on the face only half an hour after her sexual encounter...
263,"i had a nice seafood dinner this evening consisting of crab, scallops, and shrimp. everything seemed fine when i finished eating (my stomach grumbled a bit, but it's to be expected since i don't eat seafood very often).

a few hours go by and i'm sitting at my computer watching some netflix and enjoying a snack when i feel my stomach start to grumble. i need to relieve some gas, so i do the ol' sideways lean while pondering how bad this will smell.

we all know seafood tends to lead to some unique odours so midway through the lean i think ""maybe i should head to the bathroom, it'll be easier to air out."" nah, i'll just let it out, i'm already in position. big mistake.

as soon as i relax my butthole i realise that whatever's coming out of me is neither solid nor gaseous. the dreaded liquid squidgies are coming. i immediately clench myself shut, but the damage is done and i have to cowboy-walk to the bathroom.

ruined a perfectly good pair of underwear.",never trust a fart after a seafood dinner.**
264,"colossal fuckup today. i am in charge of waste management in the supermarket i work at, so part of that job is emptying the bins. i threw a bag into the dumpster today and it got caught on the edge so it was half in and half out at the end of the bin.

rather than taking the extra steps to climb down the dock ladder and push it in from the side, i stepped out onto the rim of the dumpster. as i reached for the bag, my foot slipped off the side of the bin and with a loud ""fuck"" i went straight in. luckily the only fresh waste in there was produce, and i landed standing up on a large patch of lettuce leaves.

i've got a lovely bruise and scrape on my thigh (about fist size around) but other than that i'm ok. i was going to just stay at work but by the time lunch rolled around i was feeling pretty shitty so i've come home and i'm about to take the longest shower ever. i'll go back tomorrow for some more laughter :/","took a 5 second shortcut, fell into a dumpster, went home with huge injury to pride and tiny injury to body."
265,"i was told to wash a rug today that had a rubber backing on it and was extremely gross. i asked if it needed to be washed with the hose outside but was instead told that it could be thrown directly in the washing machine. i figured that if it could be put in the washing machine i could wash it on sanitize and it would be extra clean. i was so wrong. 

the sanitize setting on my washer uses super hot water so it peeled the rubber backing right off the rug. i didn't peel it off in big sections but instead, in tiny pieces. this naturally plugged the drain. my washer was no longer draining water. 

i had to open the filter where there is a spot for emergency draining and since i had no idea what was going to happen i managed to cover my entire laundry room in water.","don't put rugs with rubber in washing machines, you will spend more time fixing your mistake then you would by washing it by hand."
266,"backstory: i'm very heavily into computers. it's been my life since i was a kid. and due to brain tumor in my sr year of high school, which caused me to drop out, i never really got into the work force. i've had small side-jobs and cash jobs. but nothing i would call a ""job""... but i've since fixed my life, got my ged, and on my way to better my life. i have been shooting emails and resumes out hoping for a response.... until...


i was outside cutting the grass when i stopped to bag the grass clippings. i heard the phone ring inside, but didn't think anything of it since it would go to voice mail. i then proceed to finish the grass. my dad comes outside (yes i live with my parent) to talk and what-not. i decided to get us some drinks, so i head inside and the phone rings again. this time from my step-mom. so i answer, talk to her, then go to hang up. that's when i see the blinking voice mail light. i went to listen to it and it starts out..

""this message is for rrims. we've received your online application and would like to schedule a face-to-face interview. please give us a call at..."" 

so i didn't think of writing down the number. i go call to my dad to come inside and take a listen (i'm excited i finally got a call back). i go to replay the message and...... deleted. i pressed the wrong button. 

we don't pay for a voice mail option on our phone bill, so we use a phone system to record the voice mails. and once you delete it on the system, it's gone forever. and i filled out so many online applications that i can't tell which one called. i can't remember the lady's name, the companies name, or the number. 


 

update 1: i went through all my applications and tried my best to match the town where she was calling from with the job i applied for. i narrowed it down to 1 job, so i shot her an email last night but haven't gotten a response yet. but i did find their number as well, so i'm calling them as soon as i finish typing this.

update 2: good news everyone! called, got through to the lady that left me the voicemail, and now i'm scheduled for an interview monday morning. i'm excited as hell! thanks a ton for all the ideas!","unemployed, desperate for job, accidentally delete my first call-back voice mail out of over-excitement."
267,"i posted this in a very dead thread a while back. it took me a fuckin' ages to write, so i'm posting it here too. so it actually happened two years ago. but it was a pretty big fuckup.

it all happened in 2011. i was just learning to ride a skateboard, so my buddy and i took his $500 longboard and my $13 warehouse (new zealand walmart) skateboard to various places around town, which i nearly killed myself, but that's another story. we ended up at the most popular skate park in town. after about half an hour of rampy uppie downies, i decided to go over the ramp which is at a sharp angle to the ground. complete ammeter me decided it would be good to put lots of my weight forwards. unfortunately, that was not the case. i fell straight down, all ~65kg of my weight on my two arms. my right arm was bent at an awkward angle. i have a photo, will upload upon request.

skip 6 weeks, have cast removed. all is well for about three months afterwards.

midway through 2011: was outside maths class, second period of the day. these were when planking was a thing, so we thought it funny if i had a go, planking on a garden. a classmate thought it would be a good idea to push me. i fell off. all was well. then i decided to give him a friendly punch to the arm. with the recently (three months ago) broken arm. pop. ""fucking shit fuck arrhgh i've fucking broken my arm again"". within moments, my maths teacher arrived. it was the first time i heard ol' smokey joe swear. a trip to the school nurse and a call to my parents left me in the emergency room. from the time i broke my arm, to the time i was given pain killers was about 45 minutes. it was hell.

see, the first time i broke my radius the full way through, and the ulna had a crack half way through. this time, i managed to break both of them completely in two.

after a quick bone straightening with local anesthetic, it looked good as new. then it was wrapped up, and i was sent on my merry way.

one week later, to get the cast removed and swapped for a spangly fiberglass one, the doctor was all ""oh, shit, it's not very straight, we're gonna need some surgery up in this bitch"" (not actual quote). my mother, who was with me says ""when will this be? we might be away for the next couple of weeks"". mr. doctor person retorts ""well, i was thinking sometime in the next 12 hours"".

next thing i new, i was lying in a bed for about 6 hours, because i wasn't allowed to eat before the surgery. standard practice, i know. considering i am right handed, and it was my right hand that broke, i was using a laptop for my school work. i played halo ce for a while, using a trackpad. i made it maybe 20% through the campaign on normal difficulty.

so i went into a surgical gown, got the ol' count back from 10; ""ten, nine, eeeiiighht, ssevvbrrrggghh"".

woke up about two hours later, completely disoriented, with my parents next to me. fuck man, my nose was itchy as a motherfucker. my mum scratched that bitch up. went back to sleep, pissed myself, had to get my bladder ultra sounded to be sure there was none left. went back to the dream time.

when i woke up, i was granted the company of older gentleman, the youngest being about four years older than myself. we had a jolly old time. then came breakfast. it was awful. the toast was rubbery, and i couldn't butter toast with my one good hand. there was soup, but i hate soup. oh, and cerial, but the milk was a little bigger than a mcdonald's sweet'n'sour sauce thing. so after about 18 hours of not eating, i had one plain piece of rubbery toast, that was barely cooked.

skip about eight weeks, cast was removed. my arm was really skinny, and really hairy. that didn't matter, i burned the hairs off on the stove anyway. hey, i was cold, and i don't have a heater. i also have a totally wicked scar about 15cm long on the underside of my right forearm. that and seven platinum screws and a stainless steel plate.

 

edit: may even still have the old video of them straightening my arm out the second time. i'll have a hunt around the terrifying abyss that is my c: drive.

edit again: i get it, two years ago wasn't ""back in the day"". it's fixed.","broke arm skateboarding, broke arm 3 months later by punching someone. arm was bent, needed surgery. wet the bed, had ultrasound. got internal bling. the toast was terrible.**"
268,"i laugh now about it. i was making dinner tonight when my eye itched. like any normal human i rubbed it with the back of my hand. the problem: my hands were full. in the one was uneatable vegetable matter, in my dominate hand were some green onions. i somehow managed to rub my eye not only with the back of my hand, but the end of the onions as well. it burned for a short bit but i am good now.",i wiped my eye with an onion.
269,"actually this was from last year but i have a lot of fuck ups from my freshmen year of college. who doesn't?



so it was my first quarter in college and i had an exam in my business law class which was at 8 am (i had no choice in taking the class). i decided to stay up late to study for it the night before. usually staying up late isn't a problem for me because i take meds for add and that keeps me up pretty late by accident anyway. this night though i was having trouble staying up so i decided to by one of those starbucks cappuccino things which was a gamble already because i'm lactose sensitive. pure milk and high quality ice cream gives me the runs and it's a toss up with any other milk products.


luckily, the milk in the coffee didn't bother me. it didn't wake me up though either. i was still extremely tired at about 3:30 so i decided to just go to sleep. this was about an hour after i drank the coffee. i went to the bathroom and i popped one of my pills so that it would gently wake me up in time for class the next day. by the time i actually got into bed it was almost 4:00.


fast forward 4 hours. i wake up suddenly, a little confused and checked my phone. it was ten till 8. then i realized something was off. i looked down. i pissed the bed. caffeine runs right through me even worse than alcohol. i got up but i didn't have time to clean myself up. all i could do was throw on a pair of waterproof track pants over my pissy shorts before i ran to class. i had to sit in those pissy pants for 50 minutes before i could go back to my dorm and shower. the worst part is that it was all for nothing because i dropped the class a few weeks later.","i drank coffee before bed, pissed the bed and overslept, then didn't have time to clean up before i went to class.**"
270,"so, it wasn't a today actually, more like a few days before last week, that i was having a conversation with my friends as usual. now, in my school, we go outside to eat lunch, so we're in the neighborhood walking down the street as i already stated, and we were walking down past a deli that nearly everyone buys at (and i was banned from it, but that's a different story). so in our little conversation, a need to shout to phrase ""fuck the police"" ran through my head and i went with it, since usually, this would go unnoticed. my luck however was different, as we were walking past and i shouted the phrase, my spanish teacher peeks out of the store and reprimands the group. the most awkward moment of it was when i bent down and apologized quietly.",version: shouted fuck the police in front of my spanish teacher.
271,"this happened about 4-5 hours ago. so here it is, several days after valentines day and i'm walking on my college campus with my girlfriend to go pick up a package her mom had sent her containing lots of valentines day candy and such.

well we pick up the package and walk about 20 feet when out of nowhere a tall skinny kid about 18-20 years old comes running and grabs the package from my hands. but here's the thing, **he's maniacally laughing the entire time.** first thought that entered my mind is i'm trying to see if i know the kid from class or a club or something, nope. quick glance to my girlfriend next to me says she doesn't know him either.

so then after about 20 seconds of trying to grab the package, he rips it open and candy goes flying everywhere. at this point, we are in the middle of the hallway in one of the busiest buildings on campus. the kid starts trying to wrestle me. sweet. i trained in mma for about a year, so i know some stuff. i immediately go for a trip takedown, and when he puts his hands on the floor to stand up, i sink in a rear naked choke. first  i'm not squeezing that hard, but then i get pissed thinking how much of a pain he caused me. by the way, i'm borderline sick today and the only reason i even went to school was because i had a huge test. add this to the fact that i'm lugging around a 30 pound backpack with books, binders and laptop, and you could see why i'm pissed when someone tries this crap on me. so here i am, applying the choke, and all these college kids (about 30 or so) have formed a big circle around me and a bunch of girls start screaming that i'm gonna kill him, and i can tell i'm about to put him to sleep, so i loosen the choke.

oh and i've got my 30 pound backpack on this whole time. i guess here is where i should mention that i'm about 5'7 and 130 pounds and this kid is about 6'0 and 200 pounds. needless to say he's got some size on me. so i've loosened the choke, but i'm still holding it firm but not squeezing at all. the kids starts grabbing my hair and just pulling the crap out of it. the girls are still yelling that i'm gonna kill this kid. so i start arguing with them, telling them he's gonna run if i let him go. they keep screaming at me. fine. i let go, and hold firm around his waist. he stands up and starts dragging me, while standing, trying to run away. i implore any bystanders to help, and these two big-ish guys help me hold him there.

finally, an employee of the college shows up and informs us that the police are on their way, but he can't touch the kid. so this kid is still dragging the 3 of us around and we're trying to hold him. finally, we agree that we'll put him on the ground. so we ground the kid and he just starts unloading punches at me, mostly top of the head, but some hit me in the jaw (which is now sore and slightly swollen). college employee jumps in and helps us hold him down til police get there.

they take, my, my girlfriend's and some other witness statements. at this point i hear a bystander mention that they know the kid and he's mentally ill. crap, i should have realized earlier. now the police pull me aside and start grilling me, asking me if i thought the kid was an imminent threat to me and actively trying to harm me. i point to the fact that he punched me in the head several times. then the officer informs me that i could be arrested for applying ""deadly force"" in the form of the choke, which is a felony. pshhh, i tell him, that's complete bs, dude tried to rob me.

so it ends with me telling the police that yes i'd like to press charges for assault and attempted robbery. and the police informing me that they will contact me and the kid may try to press assault charges on me. by the way, before someone complains, i'm only pressing charges because clearly this kid is either off his meds or on the wrong ones and they need to be adjusted. if his doctor informs me that they have fixed the medication and he is indeed taking them, and i get an apology from the kid, i will gladly drop the charges against him.","kid tries to rob me, i choke him, he punches me, whoops he's mentally ill, cops come and tell me i might be arrested for a felony in the near future; all legal advice welcome**"
272,"this is a little story about the second time that i ever sharted. this happened a couple months ago, but i haven't told anyone because talking about sharts will probably not get me a girlfriend.

so, there i am in indianapolis for the big 10 football championship. i'm originally from nebraska and my friend got offered some tickets, so we were like ""what the hell? i guess we can go watch nebraska win their first big 10 title. woot woot. party,"" and all of that stuff that you think when your team is about to totally rape it's opponent. i mean, no way could the huskers lose this game to a wisconsin team that had struggled all season, right? they certainly wouldn't have the biggest loss in 60 years, right? they wouldn't get so embarrassed that the nebraska fans would leave the game by halftime, right? the state wouldn't riot and try to get a once beloved coach fired and shit, right? i probably wouldn't shart earlier on gameday, right?

fuck that game. i've tried to forget it and move on. but just like indiana jones 4...it haunts me. it's always there. in the background of my mind. waiting to all of sudden pop into my head and ruin my whole week. there's so much more i could have done! i could've cheered harder!! why didn't i believe more?

so, back to the shart. my friend and i found a plane and hotel package that was cheaper than getting them separately. the only problem was that we had to leave on wednesday to spend five days in indianapolis. oh, well, not like i had a job or anything. and what is there to do in indy that isn't professional sports, you might be wondering. well, from the guidebooks that the hotel gave us, we quickly learned that you could get drunk a lot. we may have been sober for three elapsed hours out of this five-day excursion. (i do have to point out here that downtown indy has some phenomenal bars and chill people filling them.)

on game day, we get up early (noon) and head to our tailgate party where i waste no time in getting shmammered (shit-canned and hammered). i was so hungover from the night before that a great truth revealed itself to me:  the only cure for this monster hangover is more booze. my pace was phenomenal. i mean, people came to my table watch me pound beers and marvel at this sideshow attraction. ""i'm on vacation!"" i would shout at the on-lookers gathering with sadness and pity in their eyes. at about 12:15 pm and beer 8, i felt a rumbling in my stomach. ""that's just my hangover settling,"" i thought. i actually don't know why i would think that. that's not even a thing that makes sense to think. but i knew i had a gasbomb to expel and because i don't care about my friends, i decided to just let go. mistake #2 after getting wasted in less than an hour and literally saying, ""fuck breakfast!"" as i left the hotel.

i knew something was off immediately. how could i have not known?! i'd always been so careful! the only other time i sharted was in college. i was on a roadtrip with three other dudes and we had to drive with the windows down for four hours. i panicked, frankly. i had that look on my face that george w. bush had when they told him a plane crashed into the twin towers. i couldn't decide what to do for what felt like an eternity. so i chugged my beer and told my friends, ""i'll be right back."" then i waddled over to the restrooms.

the atmosphere in a tailgate party restroom is one of desperation. there just aren't enough toilets in the world to handle college football saturdays. the line was insane already. we're talking 35 guys in one bathroom (3 urinals and 2 stalls). seriously, they should sell beer in the restroom line, though. two reasons -- 1) if you run out, you are literally trapped in line and wasting valuable drinking time. 2) the lines are long enough, that you could just stay in line all day. pee, then get back in line and you'll need to go by the time it's your turn anyway. so it's finally my turn and i have to turn to the guy behind me in line and utter the most dreaded phrase you can on football day:  ""i'm waiting for the stall."" no one wants to hear this phrase. first of all, pooping in a public restroom when there are 35 people in it is a crime against humanity. second, every toilet is precious real estate and the small bladdered old men behind me panic because they forgot their super-beta prostrate that day. finally, i get a stall and i go in to check out the damage.

you know how poop is brown? yeah. this wasn't. it was like my water broke. my boxer-briefs were soaked. it smelled and felt like if someone had filled a water balloon with ball sweat and threw it at my ass. the smell was really overpowering. i mean, it really was like if poop could sweat. i spent a minute trying to wipe down my shorts with the one-ply toilet paper, but literally half a second later, i knew they were a lost cause. fuck it! i'll go bare-back and hope to not shart again today. now i realize what a predicament i'm in. you see, i have a fear of stripping down in a public restroom. i don't think it's that uncommon. i just don't want someone to ask why my shoes are off in the restroom. i don't want my socks potentially touching where someone's piss has splattered the ground. i don't want to chance dropping my jeans in a toilet that has had thousands of turds within it's porcelain shell. then again, maybe it is uncommon. in my previous life as a stock broker, there was this dude in his 60s that used to always be walking around shirtless in the bathroom. i'm not making this up. this dude would go into the bathroom for his post-lunch shower(?) every day and we'd all get to see him rubbing down his moobs with toilet paper. and this is who you trust with your 401ks!

so while i'm trying to get the nerve to take off my pants, i overhear the conversation on the other side of the stall. ""who takes the stall on gameday?! people should shit and puke at home! i need to pee!"" surprisingly, this gets a lot of rabble rabble rabble from the line outside. now i'm actually scared. because now i know that he said that loud enough for me and the gentleman slaughtering the cow next to me to hear. fuck it. i'll take eeeeeextra long to get out of here so he doesn't recognize me. then i get a brilliant idea. i'm strong. i'll just rip these badboys off. so i grab the cock flap thing and start tearing. boom. easy enough. get through one leg and then i realize that this was stupid as fuck. because now i realize that there's way more work than i thought. i have another leg and then there's still the waistband. ugh. the left leg proves to be harder. boxer-briefs are put together in such a way that the left leg is like all one piece? not really attached to the middle in the same way as the weaker right side. now i have to pull out my keys to dig a hole in the left side and gain the upper hand. boom. get through the left leg. i'm flushing the toilet like every couple seconds now so people can't hear the tearing noises from my stall, by the way. now for the elastic waistband. goddammit. it's too strong for keys. i can't tear it or rip it. it's elastic! it's made to resist tearing! so now i have only two choices. pull this shitty (figuratively and literally) loincloth back on and get the fuck outta this hell i've created or chew through the band.

i chose chew. it took 10 minutes because there are so many threads and elastic threads in that band. i'm almost crying when i finally break through and i'm free. now to hide the evidence. oh, fuck. how am i gonna get rid of these shit covered underwear in the bathroom! people are going to see it! i thought about flushing it. but i knew that this could turn very quickly into a farrelly brothers movie and i just had a feeling that i would have to explain all of this to the police when the toilet inevitably overflowed. i just balled them up as tight as i could and hoped that no one on the outside was looking. luck was on my side that day, friends (well...i mean...okay, i guess it wasn't really). i got to the trashcan and buried the shorts under a mountain of paper towels before anyone noticed. i wanted to run right then. fuck handwashing! don't get caught! but i knew i had to. because i had poop sweat all over my hands. i washed, breathing heavily as if i had just run away from a dinosaur.

i get to my table and my crew was like, ""where the hell have you been?"" as they handed me another beer to chug. my only excuse was a bad one. ""puking."" now everyone thinks i'm on a puke n' rally.

just then a gentleman came up to me and said my name. i turned, seeing a guy that i used to work with (not bathroom shower guy, but he sat by that dude). he then says, ""i saw you in the bathroom, guy."" my face flushed as my brain shouted at me, ""how much does he know!! murder him and hide the body!!"" he didn't tell anyone. but after that fucking game, i got wasted and blabbed about it. someone tweeted about it. the few that know still joke that ""chewing through underwear"" is code for having the most drunk fun you can have.

 

also, this is the shart story referenced here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1a9p0y/tifu_by_trying_to_nofap/",i sharted at the big 10 championship and had to eat my way out of my underwear.
273,"after a month of saving up to pay a super speeder ticket, i was finally out of debt (with *only* 6 points on my record... sigh) and had some money to spend. first thing that was on my list was an oil change and radiator hose fix for my 92 honda prelude. 

so i arrive to the auto parts store and explain to the guy what i need. he's dumbfounded by the way that i create my sentences and so i go to show him. pop my hood, point to where the bad hose is and all is looking good for my baby. like all cars, the hood had to be held up by a steel rod. my car came with the rod unbolted from the engine bay and just sits in the trunk instead. my fuck up was laying it on top of the latch that secures the hood down just so that i could go in and pay for the oil and hose quickly instead of fully closing it first. you'd expect someone to remember shit like that but nope, not me.

i come out of the store feeling like a million bucks because my car was going to get some loving care. right away i pull off onto the road. about a mile down, just like a scene from gta: san andreas, the hood of my car peels right the fuck off and lands on the side walk. there were 2 guys walking by and they were laughing their asses off at my misfortune. 

of course i do a speedy u-turn and go back to pick up what was rightfully mine. the hinges on the side were torn to hell but i still attempted to set the hood on top hoping there was some way to hold it down. and there was! the latch on the front still locked the hood down like it should have in the first place. when i get home, my mom is freaking out asking me what happened. ashamed of the my own fuck up, i tell her that i ran into a deer. 

good news is my car got its oil changed and hose fixed.","went to store for oil change and hose fix, forgot to properly lock down my hood, it peels off on the road."
274,"i've had a runny nose for the past 2 days. no problem. just use a whole bunch of tissues.

until tonight.

i really wanted some pops because i was hungry and nothing else caught my eye, so i ate a bowl of milk and the cereal.

i was laying in bed, trying to fall asleep when i shifted a bit. bad move. i start coughing ( i have a very weird dry cough so it feels like a lion's scraping the inside of my chest.) i think it will pass, but i keep coughing. like a car crash happening in slow motion, i realized i was going to throw up. i turn on the light, start leaving my room, but my stomach can't wait to make it to the toilet. i start barfing in the hallway, and put my hand up to my chin, catching all of my half digested pops and goo in my hand. i bolt to the toilet and start letting it out, using my good hand to hold my hair back. 

you never feel truly vulnerable until you are barfing up everything you've eaten in the last 6 hours with no way to call for help.

i managed to finally stop when the cupcake i'd eaten started to make an appearance, and cleaned myself up. i am writing this until i feel safe enough to go back to bed.

275,"first off, this happened over 10 years ago, back in elementary school, i have since learned my lesson and i feel horrible about my actions and wish that i could take it back. if i ever meet this girl again i will apologize profusely for the terrible way i bullied her.

back in third grade there was a girl,  lets call her ""kelly"" well anyway kelly had a chronic skin rash which i now realize was probably plaque psoriasis . anyway she was always very bright and teachers loved her. being the delinquent i was at that age, i was essentially her opposite in about every way. i eventually became so mad and jealous that teasing was the only way i could express my anger (i know this sounds kind of like in defending my actions, but trust my i'm sick to my stomach with guilt as i write this).
so i started calling her lizard girl, and eventually the whole class got into it and eventually the whole grade, she would constantly burst into years over the name calling over something she couldn't control and after 4th grade she left our school and began home-schooling because she couldn't take it. it even got so bad as she tried to cut her arms with the safety scissors in a desperate attempt to be sent home from school. years later i am so ashamed of my actions and in the off chance that ""kelly"" is  a redditor and is reading this. i am so sorry. you have every right to hate me and i don't expect you to forgive me, but i'm sorry.","i bullied a girl who had plaque psoriasis so bad, that she started home-schooling."
276,"i am so sorry.

 
i am late 20’s, 5’7”, lean with muscles, getting nicely drunk at a house party that i don’t know the hosts, or their friends. but i was invited by a stranger at the first party i was at... i rolled in with no beers as i had no money but really, there’s almost always extra beers at the middle of the evening, right? i am happy, outgoing and looking forward to meeting new chicks.

 
i don’t remember much about you (lots and lots to drink) but your robust drinking style makes up for any otherwise dealbreakers as i eye-lock you across the crowded kitchen. i am at the fridge, i open it up and grab 4 bottles of beer, signaling to you to meet me at the other side of the kitchen island to pick up your fresh beer.

 
when after fighting through tightly packed bodies i find you making your way to the meeting spot… i realize it’s going to be a very exciting night for you and me; you like beer. i smile at you and hand you a bottle. looking at my other hand you ask where those beers are going? i reply with a smirk that maybe i’m feeling thirsty. you tell me the price to meet you and talk with you is 2 beers and i had better hand over another bottle immediately. actually, i was planning to feed you another beer but didn’t think you would want to know that intention up front.

 
sweet! you can hold onto your own stash! we talk, argue, smile and both continue to drink like prohibition begins tomorrow. soon i’m forging back into the kitchen to rescue the remaining 2 bottles out of the bottom drawer where i hid them earlier, fully annihilating the expensive designer 6-pack that was never mine to drink. this party has real adults, in their 30’s, that buy the good shit, unlike the post-college party i started at.

 
blackout. yeah really. can’t remember anymore at the party, aaaaaaaaandd not really sure how we left and how we ended up at, your place. yep, your place. that’s where it happens. i think we begin sex, but not sure we finish, either of us. maybe i fell asleep on top of you and you enjoyed this passive cuddling?

 
i wake up in a panic. i have to pee. now!

 
f#ck. i’m in some strange house, you brought me here in the dark and didn’t turn on any lights as you led me into your lair…. i’m so f#cked. i have no idea where the f#ck i am. i have no idea where your bathroom is!! i need to pee!!!!

 
you keep your bedroom ultrabrutal tidy, some ocd i’m sure. maybe your binge drinking is an effort to balance the obvious control issues? but it’s cool because i’m in pain i’m trying so hard not to pee as i stand up in bed to walk off the end and onto the floor. thank god there’s nothing out of place on the floor in the dark for me to twist an ankle.

 
i think i’ve just sprained my stop-pee muscle; i have never been in this type of pain! i can’t do it. i can’t. there is no way i can wander about your house naked, with many housemates in many rooms, searching for the bathroom with the toilet, continuing to hold back the tsunami of urea and uric acid and nitrogenous wastes. fml.

 
the urine is now backing up, backing up up up into my brain. my brain is full of urine. i can’t think. i want to cry, moan, i want to sob hysterically. this is pain that morphine and fentanyl in no way can block, no way.

 
i see your closet door. i hobble the long 3-feet to the door and open it. it’s pitch black inside your closet, nothing. i need to let this tidal wave out, now! i am drunk, please remember this; i likely have a blood alcohol concentration of over 0.250 and by that i mean a lot! i am soooooo drunk, and asleep! i need to piss like yesterday, i am mad drunk and completely unconscious as i stand teetering naked at your open closet.
 

and, i, pee.

 
this doesn’t seem too bad. i mean, it’s completely dark, i can’t see a thing, there’s nothing inside this closet? it’s empty? i am peeing. much better to piss a little inside an empty closet rather than pee all over your bedroom. ohhhhhhhhhh, yes, i am peeing.

 
still peeing full force i totter a little bit inside the closet. shit, there are shoes on the floor, lots of shoes, all over the floor. peeing feels so good, nothing could feel better than complete surrender. i am peeing all over the floor, all over the shoes all over the floor. i cannot stop. this is going down.

 
then i get a good idea. if i pee in one spot then i’ll completely soak and ruin whatever is there, but if i swing all around, if i pee a little here, a little there, a little over there……. yes, that’s consideration. i am a considerate one-night stand and i’m no amateur at drinking and dating. i got this.

 
so i begin to swivel my hips and let it fly where ever it may go, in the pitch blackness. i do my best to move my stream, never too long in one spot. i feel good, i am working a plan, with kindness and compassion in my heart, i pee a solid unending stream of hot stinky urine. and then i realize that i don’t need to pee only on the floor, i can also spread it over the blouses hanging on the low rod and the things in piles on low shelves. if each item gets just a little spray then nothing is ruined. she might not even notice.

 
i pee. i pee. i pee. this will never end. i am getting tired with this work. i stop swiveling my hips, i think i’m going to throwup. i remain still, and keep peeing. playfully i do a thing that all men and boys know, i tilt my hips backward and arch the stream upward. i figure i’ll try to tag some high targets before the peak force of my pee wanes. just spreading my work out, trying to not ruin any one thing.

 
peeing. slowing down, now. slowing down. feels good to finish this load. felt like about a quart. yep, that is certainly possible when a man drinks a f#ckton of beer. a full hot oily quart of fresh piss.

 
done. i swagger back to bed and feel like sexytime but also feel like celebration will bring my stomach up thru my mouth, so i gently slide back into bed. i try to swallow some water from your nalgene sport bottle but my insides don’t want that. well, they probably do but i fear i’ll puke immediately. and i crash.

 
gotta pee!!! i open my eyes, it’s barely getting light out, your windows are large and have no curtains or blinds on them. i see you sleeping facedown, have no idea what your face looks like. can’t remember from just 5 hours earlier at the party. my head hurts, and i gotta pee. i gently stand up in bed and walk over to the edge and step down to the floor, your room is so clean. i grab my pants and put them on in awkward struggle as i move to your bedroom door. i find the bathroom just immediately down the hall, and i pee. i don’t flush because i’m considerate and don’t want to make noise so early in the pre-dawn morning.

 
as i re-enter your room i look over at the closet. oh yeah, that weird dream….. that was really f#cked up! but…..  and i walk over to the closet, put my head inside, and wait. ahhh f#ck!!!!!!!!!! it smells like a f#cking rat cage!!!!! nasty urine. everywhere!!!!!!!
 

hurrying with fear i pick up my shirt and snatch my shoes from beneath your bed. f#ck my socks? i really don’t give a shit about them at this moment. my undwear too! don’t need it!!!!!

 
i quickly lope out your bedroom door, shirtless. i cruise down the hallway, down the stairs, it’s getting lighter outside. the stairs are creaky 1920’s wooden but speed is my defense, i must keep moving fast. i must evacuate, now! i can’t seem to figure out which path is the shortest to the front door. i can’t see the front door but i can sense where it should be. f#ck it, i’ll navigate the back of the house, i’ll go out the backdoor.
 
goddamnit! i have no idea where i am and no idea how to get out of this hell hole!!!

 
i run to the left and then forward, finding the front door. i stress out, freaking that maybe it’s a keylock deadbolt that needs a f#cking goddamned key to unlock from the inside! f#ck f#ck f#ck f#ckitty f#ck!!~!!!

 
spin two small knobs, unlock the door, grab the handle, push it open…. and escape in my pants no underwear, with shoes and shirt in hand. and i run!!!!!!!!

 
i knew nobody at that party where we met. i only knew about that party by a stranger i met at the prior party. but you don’t know any of that. i can’t recall your freakin name! maybe you’ve forgot mine? as i run away i take great pains to avoid looking at any street signs, i want to get 10 blocks away in any direction before i learn where the f#ck i am. i want no reason to ever ever ever stroll past your house….. just to look……

 
eventually, i look at a street sign and learn that i’m somewhere on capitol hill, but totally no clue just exactly where and really not the first clue on how to efficiently begin walking home. no matter; presently lost, 6 miles of walking in the light rain in a cotton short sleeve shirt, no socks….. this is the easy party. this is easy. i can do this.

 
escaping that hell hole of a house with a closet putrifying from 1 quart of hot oily urine sprayed all over every single item……  that was the hard part. escape. success.
 

--

 
the next part is fiction, at least, i have no way of knowing what actually happens but i’ll do my best to paint a realistic epilogue.

 
you wake up, face down, your head hurts when you turn it. you may or may not remember “me” from last night at the party. you may or may not remember “me” from last night inside your body. it’s light out, but there’s no sunshine ‘cuz this is fall in seattle so it’s raining. of course.

 
a little bit later you do remember “me” and you remember “me” in all the ways there are to remember. a smile comes to your face, but slips off when you look about your bed, then you look about your room and you don’t find “me.” you instantly consider me a thoughtless dick, in all senses of that phrase. i ducked out after our one-nighter without even a cute note. i leave no trace to ever being there.

 
your head hurts but you know from your solid career of binge drinking that a glass of emergen-c with painkillers followed by some herbal tea will be your friends in recovery. you step out of bed and see my socks on the floor by the side of the bed and my underwear hanging from a shitty sculpture you made in highschool but still can’t seem to get rid of. you’ve no idea how or better yet why my worn-out and centerline-stained underwear are hanging from your art?

 
“maybe he’s still here? maybe he’s making tea for me? maybe he’s cooking a sweet country breakfast and using any food he finds in the frig i share with 4 passive aggressive bitchy girls?”

 
you walk over naked to your closet. you open the door. you reach inside to get your comfy robe. you grab your robe and put it on.

 
the overfull and cloistered closet smells like your 10-gallon fish tank when you were in junior highschool and had 6 mice after the original fish residents all died from lack of care. your closet smells like 4 homeless men have used it as a common urination spot for several months.

 
what the f#ck!!!!!!!!!

 
--

 
honestly, i can’t even begin to imagine what you must have thought, felt, endured from my actions. the questions you have will never have any answer that is safe and reasonable.
 

“who in the f#ck was that guy that picked me up, f#cked me (or not?), and then after i fell asleep he creeped out of bed and sprayed 2-gallons of oily stinky potty urine on everything i own??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! who does that??!! why me?????!!!!!!!!!!!”
 

i. 

am.

sorry.
 

this happened nearly exactly 20 years ago, in seattle, on capitol hill. i have finally felt the need to attempt to apologize, in some form. i have suppressed this memory, i have not thought about it. but today 2013 the entire memory was completely unearthed, no longer suppressed under a bedrock of denial.
 

i am so so sorry. so sorry.




 

edit:  i  just remembered why she had no curtains or shades on her windows even though there was a streetlight across the road that lit her room up, she said she hated curtains because they couldn't be kept clean and dust free. she was a dust / germ freak.",– i sprayed a quart of pee on all her clothes then disappeared
277,"throwaway because i'm reasonably sure i got caught on camera.

so i have an athletic competition this weekend, so i'm trying to hydrate well this entire week. yesterday, i drank two gatorade bottles of water (64 ounces) in the last hour and a half of the workday. i had an event downtown, about a one-hour drive in traffic, and i drove off not suspecting anything, and i didn't bother to empty the bladder before leaving work. 

by the time i got close to downtown, i was feeling the effects of the water, and i needed to piss. badly. well, it turns out, parking is a bitch downtown, and as expected, there were no spaces available near where i was going, nor could i just get out and pee in a bush because there were cops all around and public urination apparently causes you to become a sex offender.

you know there's that tipping point between having to pee and having to pee? if you don't (and if you said that you don't, then you're lying), imagine a dam. it's holding the water back, as more and more water builds up. then, it leaks just a little bit, as a warning that it's about to burst. that's where i was. finally, i walked into a mcdonalds, and lo and behold, it's an area where there are a lot of homeless people, so the bathrooms are locked and you have to insert a token to open the door. i went to the front, ready to burst, and asked for a token, and she said it was open. tried the door again. no luck. someone was in there. next to the door, however, there was one of those janitor buckets filled with dirty water, and i was in a fairly secluded corner of the restaurant. there was a small but noticeable wet spot on my pants at this point, so i made a decision and dropped trou and went, just enough so that i could hold the rest back while whoever was in that bathroom was taking his sweet time. 

i zipped my pants the guy finally emerges. it was a mcdonalds worker, presumably cleaning the bathroom. ""sorry, sir,"" he said in a hispanic accent. he took his mop and put it in the bucket where i just went, and carried on cleaning the floors, none the wiser. i rushed into the bathroom, finished my business, and walked out in shame as quickly as i could, but not before noticing the security camera pointed right at the bathroom doors. i had my back to it the whole time, at least, so my junk wasn't on camera for all (or at least all employees) to see.","somewhere, a guy just cleaned the floors at mcdonalds with my pee."
278,"so, i was sitting watching telly last night while tapping away on my laptop, working on an assignment. because it's the evening, and i'm an idiot, i was sipping on a hot chocolate because hey, it's cold. my cat is sat on the back of the sofa silently (unknown to me) watching the street outside, there are gasworks being done outside and they're packing away all the machinery into this container that they've put out down the road. anyhow, something freaks the shit out of my cat, being the skittish old bitch she is, and she jumps down off the sofa. she gets her claw caught in the fabric which freaks her out more. talking of freaking out, i didn't realise she was there. so mid sip, she makes me jump spilling the grainy hot chocolate eveywhere.

i look down. the floor is covered in hot chocolate, i'm covered in hot chocolate, and my laptop is covered in hot chocolate. 

i'm no technical queen, but i know shit is going down. my skin is stinging but i prioritise my the most important/expensive thing in my life, and i go get some kitchen roll. i mop up the keys, and before i go to turn it off. it goes blank.

the genius bar is booked up for the next week and i'm not around during the local repair shop's opening times, and i don't know how much is backed up. so i'm probably going to be paying for a short-circuited laptop and losing up to 5 years of photos, music, documents and whatever the hell else. 

i realise this isn't as interesting as all the other gold on this subreddit but i'm so panicked and i've got to think about this till wednesday.

 

**edit:** i've taken it to my local pc repair place, who luckily to apple products, and it has power but the monitor's  been affected, so it switches on but doesn't show it on screen. 

so the hard drive is ok :d","spilt the worst liquid you can spill on a macbook, probably short circuited it, lost up to 5 years of stuff, and i can't get an appointment to have it looked at."
279,"my fuck up happened a couple hours ago. my great grandfather is 94, really ill and close to dying. i drove across the us to see him yesterday and all night, haven't slept since monday night. so i'm feeling pretty fucking tired.

i'm standing in the hall outside his room in front of the nurse's desk and i tell my wife ""i feel like death"". her jaw drops at my stupidity, and the nurses shoot me the dirtiest looks.

280,"so i came home from school today and thought ""i'm gonna be productive!"" so i did some homework. this is were the fuck up starts.

so i was vacuuming everywhere! behind my desk, my bed and **on** the desk as i come by some old tissues i hid from when i had the ""sniffles"" and decided to vacuum that shit too (since my mom was home i didn't want to go to the bathroom and obviously flush something out) so i sucked it up, and immediately the vacuum started making crazy noises and the little red bar that tells the pressure went off the charts. suddenly it stops and starts to smoke... a lot! so i unplug it and throw it out in our driveway and pour water over it. my mum was already there and started to check it out. she undplugs the hose and sure enough are my ""sniffle"" tissues. my mum just looked at me and threw them into our garbage bin. soooo yeah this was literally 10 mins ago and shes out getting my younger sisters now.","vacuumed up my ""sniffle"" tissues and vacuum combusts."
281,"well it was lasyt night. 
anywho,  we weren at the bar and i go to the bathroom to pee after a few beers. the urinals were full so i go to a stall. i going pee and i see an empty glass on top of the toilet. so, for a reason unknown to myself i blast that fucker with beer colored piss and put it right back. 

later on i go back to the same stall and the glass was empty. now i can't say for sure it was my friend, but i all of the sudden realize upon seeing the empty glass that my friend will sometimes drink wounded strangers (rando, beer unclaimed). so i ask him about it and he immediatly goes ""no way dude of course not."" i doubt he would man up to the truth, but im prettty sure if not him, someone at that bar drank my piss.",woops
282,"well technically it was saturday (or i suppose sunday if you're one of those assholes who says ""anything after midnight is the next day"", no fuck you its until i go to sleep asswipe""). so before we get into exactly what i did you're going to need some background information, because this isn't going to be some shitty tifu post, no its going to be good (because i done bad). 
      
 so its saturday morning, and i wake up at my house, home from college for the weekend. i'm super pumped because i have a date in a few hours with a girl who goes to another college which is only about forty minutes away from mine. now this might not sound like a big deal to most of you, i mean who cares its only one date right? wrong! this is the first date i've ever been on. yes with anyone (i hope you're getting all excited right now like ""dis gon be good""). anyway so the time comes and i get a ride down there from my parents who were going down there anyway. so they drop me off and leave, alls good and well. i text her tell her shes there and she comes down. now at this point i'm sitting in the lobby, nervous as hell because 1) i've never been on a date and 2) i don't actually know exactly how attractive this girl is because i've only met her once. she comes down and i'm caught totally offguard because shes fucking gorgeous, and i'm like ""err hi"" (beautiful i know). anyway we go out to lunch at a really well known restaurant that's pretty cheap, and it goes ok. it had like this feeling of awkward because i'm 99% sure it was both of our first dates ever. anyway like i said it goes ok, i insist on paying the bill because i'm a male therefore i must, and we leave. 
           
 at this point we go back to her dorm and just hang out. i see some guys i know and we all hang out and everything goes well. as time goes on everything starts to get better and better. i'm relaxed at this point so i'm making jokes, people are laughing, its all good. then some guy comes up and is like ""yo lets go pregame this party that we're all going to tonight."" now this isn't that big of a deal for me, i was going anyway so why not drink. well for starters i'm fucking 150 pounds and secondly i may or may not be under 21. but yolo i like alcohol why not. so me, this girl, and like 3-4 of her friends go to this dudes room and pregame. pretty much everyone has like 3-4 shots, except me, because i'm going to impress this girl. so instead of having a few shots, i have fucking ten, in about 15 minutes. so as you can imagine i'm fucking trashed.

 at this point we all start hanging out, and everything is still going reasonably well, i'm positive that there will be a second date. a few hours pass, not much happens, and then we go out. we walk for fucking ever and i'm still pretty trashed, though i haven't drank anything since so i'm doing alright. we end up at some random house with nothing but jungle juice. now i'm not a big drinker, so i don't know exactly what jungle juice is, but me being both drunk and out to impress has 3 full solo cups full. yeah you're probably cringing right now because either you have  taste buds and you're like ""who the fuck could ever have more than one glass of that shit"", or if you're not so lucky you're just thinking ""ok this kids fucked."" well we stay out for about 3 hours and i'm feeling shitty. i end up sitting on some porch by myself just like ""aww shit this is bad i'm feeling awful."" after about what turns out to have been 45 minutes of this i see 4-5 people leaving, including the now much more attractive girl (beer goggles) who i had been on a date with earlier. so i get up, suppress the urge to fucking vomit everywhere, and walk with them back to their lobby. on the way back she's chatting with another guy, which i honestly didn't care about in the least, and i'm just following the group. but when we're almost there she says ""hey could you get someone else to sign you in i think i'm just going to go up to my room and go to bed."". i say its fine, but in reality that fucked me really hard because the other person who normally signs me in is hooking up with some chick in his room. so she leaves, and i go and sit down in the lobby. 

 i text him twice, and he answers that he'll be down eventually. as i sit there i progressively get worse and worse, until its inevitable that i'm going to puke. so i stand up, get hit with a wave of nauseate so intense i think i'm going to die, casually walk over to a trashcan, and to the dismay of twenty people lose my stomach into a trashcan. after about 2-3 bouts of this someone who i'd met earlier in the day walks over with a waterbottle and tells me that she went and got my friend. i stand there, thank her profusely and down the water bottle. at this point i'm not totally sure whats going on, but she guides me over to a chair and tells me to sit down, which i drunkenly manage to do. at this point i close my eyes in the chair, and when i open them again i see two of the ra's for the dorm standing there talking. one of them asks me if i have an id, which i am somehow able to conjure up. i close my eyes again and this time when i open them i see three cops, my friend, the two ra's, and out of the corner of my eye the girl who i went on a date with. fuck!!! i ask if i can move further into the lobby so she can't see me, and they allow it.
 
 the cops look at the id, and proceed to ask my a number of questions that are never good such as ""what is your name"" and ""how old are you"". after about three minutes of this one of the cops asks me ""alright daniel, how old are you?"" to which i reply ""i'm 19"". he then asks ""and what is the legal drinking age in this state?"" at this point i'm just thinking that i'm totally fucked in every way possible, but i answer that it is ""21 sir"". the cop then goes on to say ""now daniel, if you were to apply for a job in ten years, and you have an underage, and your friend here applies for the same job without an underage, who do you think will get the job."" annnnnnnnnnd i'm fucked. but i still answer the question in the most professional way i'm capable of at this point which is ""well sir, i'm not totally sure, but if i had to guess i'd say my boy over here is going to get the job, but i think he would anyway cause he's asian."" the cop at this point is suppressing a laugh, because that is a pretty fucking stupid thing to say. so he hands me my id and says ""ok since you sound coherent and you don't have the ""stumbly umblies"" (that's a direct fucking quote) i'm gonna let you off with a warning."" at this point i'm shocked and awed, so much so i can't even say anything. i deserved that citation, and yet i'm not receiving one, and i think to myself that its a fucking miracle. i stutter out ""thank you so much."" and get up. the ra hands me back my id and i go up to my friends room. now, unfortunately for me the story isn't over. my friend is a great guy, but he's fucking pissed, because he was about ten seconds from getting laid for his first time before he had two ra's knocking on his door that his friend was throwing up in the lobby. so he's pissed, and he ends up putting me in his room and leaving to try and find this girl. i throw up some more and then end up passing out.
         
 as of right now i have only talked to this girl for about 5 minutes since that night and she hasn't responded to 2 of 3 texts i sent her, and the one she did respond to was only 5 messages, which is incredibly unlike the conversations that had previously taken place. also my friend and i are on better terms, but he's definitely still mad. oh and i may be banned from that dorm permanently because there was an incident report filed, which may or may not hurt my chances of being able to transfer there like i had planned.",i'm pretty sure there won't be a second date.
283,"well, i have a new girlfriend. her name is caitlyn. 
i live at home with my mom, grandma and great grandma (so much estrogen). anyway, my great grandma broke her femur a while back and can't walk. we don't leve her alone for extended periods of time. 

start the story!

alright, so caitlyn and i grab some coffee after class when my grandma calls me. she tells me she had to leave my great grandma. now that means i need to get home, but not in any particular rush. so i offer to drive caitlin home before i head to the homestead. she says it's fine and that we can chill at my house (awesome). so we get to the house and walk in to meet my great grandma. she's 93 and weighs about that much. she has a pretty bad memory and sometimes calls me dennis (my dead uncle, not me). 

so we walk in and she says ""hello ben, who is this?"" and i say ""mamaw this is caitlyn."" caitlyn says hi and then my great grandma turns to me and says ""wasnt her name rachel the other day?""


fuck. 

""what? no. you've never met caitlyn.""

cue caitlyn, after pulling me aside: ""who the fuck is rachel?""


now i have no idea what to say, because i don't know of any rachels that have been in my house. so i say the first thing that comes to my mind: 


cue the fuck up

""my other girlfriend.""

now it would be easy to read sarcasm into a comment like this, but my tone was not sarcastic and accidentally sounded quite serious. 

she didn't say much else the rest of the day. i tried to explain, but she didn't believe me. it also happens that i know a rachel from another class and she hits on me a lot, so when i handed caitlyn my phone to show my monogomy, rachel decides it is the best time to text me and say ""what's up big dick? wanna fuck tonight?""

rachel is joking, but put into context, i can see how caitlyn construed the whole situation. 

unfortunately for me, rachel was kidding, because now i'm single :(



 

edit: caitlyn and i talked last night. things are looking better. she's actually going to meet this rachel and see just how not serious this is. so far everything is getting less fuckedupish.",gf meets great grandma. great grandma calls her another name. person with the same name texts me a r-rated message moment later.
284,"this actually happened last night so i guess it's more like lnifu.  anyway, i was watching tv, being generally lazy after putting the kids to bed and decided that during the next commercial break i'd go get my nightly snack.  so the commercial comes on and i decide to try and pull a risky business slide across the kitchen floor because hey, that's always fun, right?  so i go into my slide like a pro, arm outstretched to grasp the cabinet knob as it comes into range and successfully open the cabinet door in one fluid movement.  i remember opening the cabinet with my left hand, reaching in with my right hand to grab the delicious fiber brownie goodness, and then i remember a feeling of euphoria and being very comfortable, like i'm laying on clouds.  so i open my eyes and i'm staring at the ceiling, having somehow ended up on the kitchen floor.  i realize at that point my nose and big toe are throbbing painfully and i kind of start to panic.  

what i imagine happened was, upon completion of my risky slide, i stubbed my toe on the underside of the dishwasher, bent forward in exclamation directly into the cabinet door i'm opening with gusto and knocked the bridge of my nose in a violent manner and collapse upon impact.  that's the only logical conclusion i could come up with, so i stagger up, gather my snack, and shamefully wander back to the couch after realizing i was kod by the kitchen cabinet.  the commercials are still playing so i was only out for a few seconds at most.","kitchen cabinet likes fiber brownies, fights me for it, i lose by ko."
285,"as of recent i have been contenting myself towards the end of the day by (amongst other things) trawling through websites looking for a nice watch. when i find one, i often take picture of them with my phone and save them to compare them all at the end.

on this particular occasion, i had come across a multitude of very appealing watches, more than one of which i would be more than tempted to buy. to help me decide which was the watch for me, i consulted my ever-present style icon (sort of); my father.

giving him my phone, i told him to scroll through photos of all the watches i had found recently, while i put the kettle on (tea is a staple dietary requirement in my household). i come back into the living room with the tea and notice that he is no longer looking at the watches, instead intently focused on the tv with my phone face down on the arm of the chair beside him. offended, i ask him why he's not looking at them any more as i pick up my phone. i realised why.

i had been, for lack of a better word, sexting a member of the opposite sex (i'm a guy) for the previous few nights and had, of course, forgotten to delete the photos from my camera roll. upon picking up my phone, i was present with a photo of me, completely naked, with my clearly erect penis in my hand.

without consulting my dad further on his choice of watch, i left the room and have not made eye contact since. 

 

edit: spelling, grammar, etc.",i dickpic'd my own father.
286,"today i stopped at the local gas station to grab a cheap drink that came in a styrofoam cup. after i got home, i decided to make some supper and started cooking some ground beef on the stove. i soon needed something to put the grease in, so i grabbed a nearby empty sonic cup. i go about cleaning up and such and feel a bit thirsty. i grabbed the wrong cup and took a big sip of some grease. i immediately started freaking out and spit it out in the kitchen sink. luckily, it had cooled down so i didn't scorch my mouth.",i drank grease instead of dr. pepper because i'm dumb.
287,"ok i know yall hate this but its a great story that happened to me 8ish years ago.  enter a very hungry korinthia into the kitchen. ohshit.jpg leftover toasted raviolis! (for anyone not from the midwest, more specifically st louis, these are breaded and fried meat ravioli, fucking delicious) so i'm like no way i'm ruining these by tossing them in the microwave, no sir these are going to be reheated properly in the toaster oven. now this wasn't any toaster oven, this was a great cook-your-food-perfect-every-time toaster oven, this was a my parents wedding gift toaster oven. so i pop those suckers in and commence heating my delicious taste sensation. 13 year old me is like hey do you know what would be a great idea? fuckin around on the computer for 6 minutes thats what! *45 minutes later* *sniff sniff* what the fuck is bur..oh shit. as i sprint towards my kitchen its clear my whole house is full of smoke. i approach the toaster oven to discover that my precious ravioli have turned into several flaming charcoal briquettes. so i grab the door to open it and immediatly burn my hand. i grab a towel and open the door. shit shit wtf am i gonna do. so genius 13 yo me throws a glass of water at the flaming ravioli. for those of you that arent aware hot glass+cold water=explosion. the glass door on the toaster exploded sending glass everywhere. the glass lands on my kitchens hardwood floors leaving numerous large scorch marks (that are still there to this day). needless to say my parents werent pleased. my whole family still bitches about the shitty toasters weve had ever since and my mother still teases me about ruining her floors.",threw water on flaming food in toaster glass door explodes leaves scorch marks on hardwood floors and ruins toaster. whoops
288,"not today but last year.
so i'm a part timer working for the british army voluntarily. occasionally i work with cadets but mostly do paperwork. anyway now and again i get the chance to apply for more exciting work which can include having to visit quite senior officers. 
so i was sitting at a desk filing in forms about how many piles of mud needed to be cleaned and which maniac should be let loose with a shovel when i was summoned to the company commanders office. 
now i had been sat for about 3 hours and drinking a lot of water so naturally i decided to head to the toilet first. a tricky thing deep ding on what uniform your wearing because there can be a lot of zips, be,to, buttons and things called baffles where it's like a double pocket that requires a lock pick, crowbar and spoon to get into. so i go so my business then do up what i think is my fly and walk to the office of the officer.
i knock, get told to enter and walk in and salute.
inside is the officer, the sergeant major and the adjutant who is in fact a woman.
the adjutant looks at me, giggles and leaves the room as i stand to attention.
the major coughs looks a the csm and then coughs again before saying. ""perhaps you should...ummm... do your zip""
at attention i cannot move until told to do so, so i look down to see my cock dangling from my trousers. but it's worse.
because of the way my trousers are my penis is not hanging out, it's sticking horizontally towards the desk. hurriedly i try to zip it up but the zip gets stuck as i'm furiously trying to do up the zip. as i struggle i inadvertently let go of the zip and my hand flies out to knock a photo off of the desk.
i stop. calmly pick up the picture, with dick still free and acting like its saluting the officer pointing at the major as it slowly becomes more frightened and tries to retreat into my trousers. i place the photo on the desk, salute and leave the office. managing finally to zip up the fuckin' trousers.
next day i get transferred to another company.",saluted a major with my cock.
289,"some backstory, my parents left me home alone for a week while they where in las vegas. so of course i tried to do what any teenager left home alone for a week would try to do, have a huge party. 

with the plan in place i got some of my friends to help me setup, we moved almost everything that was breakable into siderooms, even some of the furnature. the doors to those rooms where then locked, with the key inside, the only way in, unscrew the door handel. 

i got two of my buddies to bounce, one at the front exit one at the back, we had lists with all the guests, as to make sure nobody extra got in. lights and sound were all taken care of, and it was set to be a huge party. people from different schools all over town where coming, 

now reddit, heres the big twist, im not really a party kid. nor do i get invited to very many big parties. so having some of the most popular people around begging to get in, to my party, it was like being a king. 

night of the party (last night) finally rolls around, and at 9:00 a few people show. immidiently they ask where they can go to smoke, i told them to exit the backyard, through the gate and smoke in the little park i back onto. a total of l20 steps away, but because it was raining they wanted to smoke under the patio umbrella; which i reluctantly allowed. telling them just to toss their cigarette butts over the fence. 

my neighbours, who are really good friends with my parents saw, and about contacted my parents, my parents gave them permission to break up the party. then it happened, not fifty minutes in, whilst i was outside making a phone call. my neighbour unlocked the front door (they have a backup key incase we get locked out) and started screaming for people to getout. there you have it reddit, thats how i fucked up, and lost my parents trust, while also becoming the laughing stock of the school.","hosted a party while parents where away, got shut down not even an hour in. parents dont trust me, and im the laughing stock of the school.**"
290,"i've been in a pretty serious relationship with a great guy for about 5 months now. we even started talking about a future together and i knew we would be going out for quite a while. i'm 20 f and he's 27 but the age gap doesn't bug either of us. 

i'm away visiting my parents for a month right now, really really far from my boyfriend. everything was going great, we would talk every day and although i miss him so much it's not bad. and then i had to go clubbing. i didn't really want to go, but my friends insisted on it (bought my ticket already). so i went. and drank. and drank. and drank. i'd been going through some personal rough patches and really felt the need to get hammered, which is the stupidest thing to do in my situation. but i did it anyway.

next thing i know with two guys and i've agreed to have a threeway? i can barely speak at the point and just didn't care about anything. i had my first threesome with them. i felt like it was too late to back out, that it would be easier for me to just finish the job than to get away at that point. i can't even remember their names. i feel used and guilty. did i actually agree to something like this? what is wrong with me? how can i hurt him like that?

the boyfriend is suspicious. he knows that my texts didn't add up. he knows something went down last night but doesn't know what. now i don't know what to do. i don't know what to tell him and how. i want to be honest but i don't want to hurt him. i hate myself and i want to die. i am scumbag stacy. fml.",i'm a fucking dumbass
291,"well, to start it off, throwaway for obvious reasons. a little back story: my sister introduced her friend to me a couple years ago, turns out she really liked me since she first saw me so i decided it would be best to not get too close to her, i had already had my girlfriend for a year, and i still do to this day. i'm currently a senior, the other girl, let's keep her unnamed, is in 8th grade but had to start a year late because of birthday. alright, on with the story.

so i decided after seeing a facebook post about her self harm, i'd message her and try to help her out. over the next two days, find out she still likes me. she thinks i'm cute, i'm funny (we've never talked until now), and is basically obsessed with me. she's a pretty depressed person, so i think ""oh what the hell, she could probably use a friend, nobody really seems to like her."" i think i may have found out why. but she isn't the one all to blame..

i hung out with her today (7/31). it started off nicely, she has an 11 week old german shepard puppy we took to the park for about an hour to play with it and stop every 5 minutes to get told how cute it is and let people pet him. his leash ends up breaking, because as most people know, puppies love to chew on shit. so she picks him up, and we head back to her house. we just sit around in her garage, talking for about another half an hour. after a while we get bored, so we decide talking in the kitchen would be a better idea. don't know why, we just did. puppy finally falls asleep, so she's more careless on how she is. she's one of the people who jokingly calls their friends ""whore"", ""slut"", etc. you get the idea. well, eventually her jokingly calling me whore means ""oh i'm gonna grab your boobs because i think it's funny."" at this point i'm very confused, like, what the fuck is going on? so i'm like ""okayy..."" and start to back away. she drops a gem on me, ""oh you can do it back, i don't care haha"" and ends up putting my hands on her boobs, which are huge btw. so, being a guy in high school, girlfriend or not, i obviously pop a chubby. so i start getting more careless too. it ends up into a full on groping session. after that finally ends, we go back to the garage and i sit down in a chair. that turns to ""i'm going to sit on your lap facing you, and still ""jokingly"" grab your boobs and raging hard on.""

oh okay. that definitely goes over well for a high schooler. goes on longer, little by little of ""jokes"" like liking the others cheek/face, more groping, to eventually kissing, fingering and a blowjob. woah. that went crazy. 2 hours ago i was sitting there talking to her with a fucking adorable puppy, now i'm getting blown and flickin her bean. her brother is coming home soon, so i need to go since nobody even knew i was there, which was nice to know as i was about to leave. giving her a hug to leave (not sure why i did it, probably my dick thinking more than my mind) she whispers in my ear ""next time, we can do something more. 3 letters.. s-e-x."" what the fuck. this chick is 4 years younger than me, tricked me into feeling her, fingering her, and letting her blow me, then wants to fuck me? and i have a girlfriend?! 

god i felt like complete shit after i left. i was shaking. nothing felt right to me, and i even hung out with my girlfriend today after that. she just left recently so i decided to come on here and share my story. so far, the other girl and i have talked after the incident, and we're agreeing that we both fucked up, and neither of us are bringing it up to anyone or each other anymore. trying to forget about it. i still feel like i fucked up big time and i'm a complete asshole.",depressed chicks are the horniest
292,"was thinking about it, but fuck a throwaway.

so i read a comment on reddit a few days ago in the thread of ""don't knock it til you try it"" about how baby wipes were superior to toilet paper. there weren't any baby wipes in the bathroom at work, but there were some hand sanitizing wipes. i figured they were the same thing. big mistake. whereas baby wipes have a soft, moist feeling of relief, hand wipes are extremely alcoholic in content. over 65% alcoholic, to be exact. you can see where this is going. the moment the hand wipe made contact, it felt like someone had lit a molotov cocktail in my asshole. i had to keep working with an ass of fire for another hour before i could clean up.",wiped my ass with a hand wipe which was more alcoholic than most vodkas.
293,"so i decided to take a little trip to the coast in italy, travelling alone so unfortunately nobody to help me keep my head screwed on. it started with a quiet sunset beer, absolutely stunning setting in a fairly sleepy town. i then met a group of australians and the beer drinking continued. cut to 3 hours later and i'm left with a group of italians we'd also met that evening but slowly realising i'm losing the ability to speak in either language. i decide to be 'sensible' and head back to the hostel at this point before i make things worse. oooh but they were already far too bad. i climb into bed, and obviously everything starts spinning. crashing down from the top bunk i run to the toilet to have a mega chunder, thinking it's all over i clamber back onto the bunk. considering how noisy hostel beds can be and my inability to walk in a straight line i undoubtedly pissed off the rest of the dorm with all my to-ing and fro-ing. this process repeated 3 or 4 times before i finally find myself being helped up from the kitchen floor by a very kind stranger who was also staying in the hostel. for one reason or another i was topless (female here) so he kindly wrapped me up in a sarong and showed me back up the stairs. 
random drunk guardian angel man, i don't know who you are but thank you. consider the sight of my probably puke-covered boobies as payment in return for your kind services. even if you're gay, everyone loves boobs, right? he was sleeping when i left so i left a note thanking him, signed 'the drunk naked girl'. 
fortunately i remember everything but i seriously need to be more careful. drink responsibly, kiddies.",got really drunk and passed out in youth hostel kitchen topless to be later guided to bed by a stranger in the night.
294,"today i decided to have a lazy day, basically lounge around in a shirt and shorts doing nothing apart from watching films.i hear a knock on the door and stand up to answer it forgetting that i am wearing shorts with buttons on the front.
i open the door to find a neighbour from across the road. i should mention she has known me since i was a baby and does a lot of stuff for the church and had brought across the church newsletter and to ask about my grandma.
anyway, i open the door and she looks at me and then looks directly into my eyes her gaze never wavering as she asks about my grandma then walks wi all the speed of an injured turtle down the path again. i'm kinda figuring at this point that something is up. she seemed flustered and stared into my eyes as though her life depended on it whereas normally she tries to look around me to find something to gossip about like the mess in the hallway.
as i close the door wondering why she was so odd i look down to see my dick hanging out of my button flies which have somehow come undone like a curious visitor wanting to visit the outside world.
i can only thank god no one else was in the street.",i opened the door with my cock out to an old lady by accident.
295,"a couple days ago i went through a round of physical therapy for my left knee; however my physical therapist must have felt like showing off to his cute new “intern”. as a result he had me contorting into all kinds of weird shapes, doing strange exercises and having me hold stretches longer than usual. because of his need to show off, it caused my leg to reach a soreness level to where i had a limp when i walked.

i needed some relief from the soreness; like any other athlete i reach for my favorite analgesic called biofreeze. biofreeze uses this menthol combination that you roll onto sore or achy parts of your body which creates this cooling effect and promotes blood flow to the area. the primary soreness on my leg was on the inside of my thigh that wrapped around the inside of my leg up to the bottom of my ass. so i applied a generous portion of analgesic to my sore area and immediately starting to feel the cooling sensation. it was great!

standing there in my kitchen enjoying the cooling sensation for a minute or two, i got in my car to pick up my wife from work. big mistake as i was wearing boxers at that time. as i sit down, my ball sack comes into contact with my thigh and bathes in the analgesic that i just applied. immediately i feel this intense cooling sensation on my family jewels. i don't have time to wash it off, because i have to get my wife. so i back out of my driveway, adjust my sack, and start trucking down the road.

about two miles down the road that cooling sensation hits its peak. it now feels like i'm squatting over a bucket of ice water, dipping my stones into an ice bath. at this point i am trying to drive while adjusting my gonads, spreading my legs, trying to stuff my boxers between my manhood and my thigh; nothing seems to be working; the deed has been done.

thirty minutes later i arrive back at the house, my nards feeling like they got icicles hanging from them that would make santa jealous. i step out of the car hoping for some relief, but no… apparently there was a surplus somewhere of liquid ice as it reapplied itself to my coin purse. so i rush into the house, with one hand on my giggleberries. i find a roll of god’s finest creation, paper towel. i fling off my shorts, and begin to scrape off the imaginary icicles to much success. finally some relief from that icy death…

so i get into bed, and flip on my favorite netflix show and roll over, and somehow my yambag finds another surplus of biofreeze… again…","got biofreeze on my ball sack; felt like i just dipped it into a bucket of ice water. couldn't clean it off; had to pick up wife from work. had frozen giggleberries for at least 30 minutes before relief. went to bed, my nutsack found another surplus of biofreeze; froze my ball sack again; gave up and went to bed."
296,"so my family is having a big reunion this weekend and my mom wanted a specific kind of mosquito repellent that she could only find on amazon.  since i have amazon prime, i said i would 2-day ship it to her house so that it could be there in time for the festivities.

also, last fall, my now ex-girlfriend was moving to a different city for work while i finished up my masters.  in order to make the distances more bearable, we decided to order something to make the experience more enjoyable.  since the company making this was a startup, they were plagued with manufacturing and logistical delays that many startups are, leading them to continuously push back the expected ship date.  since i am moving soon and had no idea when they would ship, i changed my address to my parents address to assure that i would be able to still get them, should i have moved before they arrived.

this morning my mom receives a box labeled to me from fedex and obviously assumes that it was the mosquito repellent that i had shipped to her, so she opens it without a second thought only to find various sex toys for both male and female intended for her (now single) son.

297,"alright, so i'm sixteen right now, and i don't have very good personal hygiene. in fact, i haven't brushed my teeth nightly for years.

anywho, my younger brother had a checkup about a month ago, and my mom liked the dentist and said that we should come in later and get me a few fillings. (i have tourette's syndrome, so finding a dentist isn't really easy.)

well today was the day of my 10:00 appointment, and said dentist happens to live two hours away, meaning that i had to get up at like 6:30, which is six hours earlier than i normally get up.

to prepare for this, i went to bed super-early and had a horrible night of sleep tossing and turning.

fast-forward a few hours, and i'm at the dentist's office. we come in, she takes a few pictures, everything goes fine, then she starts stabbing my gums and my teeth are kinda sensitive there, so it was just the amount of uncomfortable where you can bear it, but you really don't like it.

the gum stabbing caused bleeding, which she had to wash out. normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but the water is cold as hell and my teeth didn't like it.

so i'm sitting there for an hour while she looks at my gums, and she finally decides to start checking out my *teeth.*

so as if my gums weren't bad enough, she's poking my sore molars and scraping all over. then when she finishes, she ""polishes"" them with a little mini buffer thing. it didn't feel good.

then she calls dad over and gives him the briefing, and she has diagrams and everything. apparently, ***all of my teeth but one have horrible cavities in them.*** she then comes up with the plan of having me come in *five more times* to get fillings.

and how much does this cost us?

$5,000, which is really bad because both of my parents are unemployed. (dad's retired, and mom just quit a really stressful job.) i'd go get one myself, but we live too far out of town for me to work 3 hours a day at winn-dixie.

so we finally leave the dentist's, and my teeth are sore as hell from gum poking. everyone's hungry, so we decide to stop at golden corral. (i don't care about the dumpster food, we were hungry and they had good pork steaks.) my mouth was aching the entire time, and only stopped hurting an hour or so ago. (11:33 now)

*","* didn't brush teeth for ten years, went to the dentist, found that every tooth but one has a cavity or two, whole thing is gonna cost $5,000 and i still need to make five more trips. also, they had a tv above the chair playing ""shrek the third"" which i got to watch from beginning to end twice in one visit, which was probably the most painful part."
298,"so i brought my 3ds in the bathroom and most would expect that i would drop it in the toilet right? well,it went a bit differently. i set my 3ds down by the sink and after washing my hands it magically flew into the bubble filled sink. i panicked and quickly opened it to find the bottom screen all glitchy and messed up. i just paced a bit and hoped it would fix itself.

eventually it did. for 5 minutes,and now it refuses to even turn on. it's from launch day and the warranty has expired and cannot be extended,and i will probably go without pokemon x and y or the smash bros 3ds i was so looking forward to unless i manage to make up the money for either a. a fix b. another 3ds. sorry if this sounds kinda like me whining about my electronic problems but i'm a bit bummed out.


 
edit: the bottom screen has started working again but glitched out and stopped working entirely on one occasion,i'm just gonna put it in rice and hope for the best.","broke 3ds,no pokemon or smash bros."
299,"so, it started a few months ago when i went to go help my friend with his film project. it was one of those kinds of projects that required copious amounts of food-colouring blood and fake weapons, because he's a huge tarantino fan. i needed to carry a lot of stuff on me, so i carried it around in a backpack.

today, i was leaving for a flight to thailand. i had already packed my suitcase the night before, but i only packed my hand carry in the 20 minutes before i left. in a rush, i picked a random bag out of my closet. 

when i arrived at bangkok, where i'd have a quick stopover before taking a connecting flight to chiangmai, i was faced by a cursory bag inspection. *no problem,* i'm thinking, when suddenly the attendant gets this surprised look on her face, then pulls two realistic-ish looking toy pistols out of the front pocket of my bag.

the people behind me first look a bit scared, then start nervously giggling as i desperately try to explain to the attendant. eventually, i give up and start walking towards my gate after the attendant confiscated the props. i felt really lucky that that was all that had happened, and i didn't get detained for questioning and/or miss my flight.","left prop guns in my bag, bag gets searched at airport"
300,"definitely one of the most awkward moments of my life. i was walking back through edinburgh city centre and i saw a man with a cup of coffee with no lid, and he was sitting on the ground, so i thought he was homeless. i felt around in my pockets for some loose change and found a few coppers. i went over and put them in the coffee cup, only to realise that he had coffee in it and that he wasn't even homeless, he was waiting for someone. there was a good 5 seconds of super awkward confusion and staring.","i thought a man was homeless and put change in his cup of coffee, he wasnt homeless and had coffee in the cup."
301,"a few people from a post i submitted on this sub a while ago wanted to hear another story about the music department [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1p5vk6/tifu_by_doing_a_weewee_behind_the_school_piano/) is the first story about pissing behind a school piano. 

so, without further-ado, here's the story about the time i said my music teacher's husband has ed. 

as before, i'll include some background info:
- my music teacher had gotten married over the summer holidays, and this incident happened in about november. around about the time of the piss incident. (still in year 10 in this story)
- the teachers at my school joke about a lot with the students. a teacher would call another student something offensive and we'd get on with it, it's natural at this school. 
- this particular teacher is very 'up herself', but will sometimes have her good day. **day**. let's call her miss yellow.

it was a month before the *christmas carol concert* was due to take place, and our school would always put on some stupid show. being a strong atheist, i don't like doing this, but i do it because i love music and it seems stupid not to, plus my friends do it and it's a laugh. this year we're doing mistletoe & wine. i have a friend, and let's call him joe. me and joe have a weird sense of humour, and we'll often joke about things without realising how bad the joke is. we're definitely going to hell. 

joe, for reasons i'm still unclear of, took music as a gcse. he hates the lesson and doesn't play an instrument. for mistletoe & wine he had the luxury of playing the shaker. even miss yellow had given up hope, and he's still on the course somehow. anyway, instead of playing the amazing instrument that is the egg shaker, he was fucking about with a drum stick and hitting it against the desks to piss off the teacher. he got a splinter, and miss yellow was happy about this and laughed. joe said ""miss, i can't get it out!!"" to which i replied ""you can't get it *up* either, can you joe?""

we laughed. it wasn't the most offensive joke ever, it wasn't even offensive, but we laughed. 

""dannii!"" from my music teacher was what broke the laughter. i, innocently, replied with ""but miss, how did you know we were talking about *that*?"" to make her seem like the 'bad' one. 

""that's because her new husband has it. hahahahahaha!!"" exclaimed joe. 

nice one..

it was very funny, the 'group' i hang about (there's 4 of us) all laughed. the rest of the class was either laughing or was silent in shock at what he said. i silently, but loud enough, said ""yeah"". 

""dannii!"" miss yellow shouted again. 

*oh shit*. you could tell when she's not happy.. and she most **definitely** wasn't happy. 

""both you boys go to see miss red* and tell her what you said!"" (hey, that rhymed..) *let's just call the other music teacher miss red. 

i continue playing guitar, and joe goes to see miss red. all's fine until miss red comes through the door and asks to see me. 

*double shit*

now, me and miss red get on quite well, as she sees me as a very good guitarist and will often call me, and my other 'guitar friend' (of whom is in the 'group') a* students. but this time i knew i had fucked up. 

she took me out and there was joe. he was standing there with an expression on his face that looked as though he was constipated, but he was obviously trying not to burst out into laughter. i had to repeat the entire story to miss red. she wasn't happy. she gave us a 'double red card'. this meant that we had an instant slt (senior leadership team - basically the principal and other people high up in the school) detention. we had to go to the drama teacher and tell him what we did and that we had received a double red. 

he laughed. a lot. he said ""well, you still have to stay for the detention, but you won't have to stay for the slt detention. just don't let it -laughs- happen again""

miss yellow was happy because she doesn't like us. miss red said that she only did it because it was the 'right' thing to do, but found it slightly funny nonetheless.",said my music teacher's husband has erectile dysfunction and got a detention for it.
302,"i am big time enthusiast fish keeper. i have about 5 aquariums in my home, but i have to maintain several other containers as quarantine tanks and breeding tanks. these containers are usually buckets and other pitchers which have their temperature and other parameters maintained. 

from the past few days, i could smell a faint but rancid smell near my door. i thought maybe ive missed the water change on one of the containers. so i checked all the containers beneath a shelf just besides the door. all of them had their water changed according to the schedule, and all the fishes were healthy.

a few more days passed, and the smell became stronger gradually. today the smell became unbearable, so i decided to change the water in all the containers regardless of the schedule. when i took the containers out, i found my grand fuck up staring at me. it was a large tub that had a breeding pair of three spot gouramis[wiki link](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/trichogster_trichopterus_13.jpg), both of these fishes were in pristine condition when they had entered the breeding tank, but when i checked the schedule on the tank, i had somehow managed to push it back behind the [zebra danios](http://www.seymourfish.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/zebra-danio.jpg) and [pearl gouramis](http://www.aquariumdomain.com/images/fish_freshwater/pearlgourami1.jpg), and completely forgot about the water change schedules :(

the result, i had to clear out about 14 gallons of fish stew, cooked at about 27c for maybe two weeks. and this wasn't even the worst part of my fuck up. when i was somehow trying to throw the water away, the smell became just too much, and i puked onto my [pet bird](http://imgur.com/qqiwzv8) and his cage on the way to the bathroom.","completely forgot about some pet fish, which turned my room into a gas chamber, then puked on my pet bird while trying to clean up"
303,"so i've recently started seeing this guy, i know he;s liked me for a long time, but i only recently realized that i actually really like him. we're hunkering down for a night of movies and alcohol as per usual when he suddenly drops it. he's like, yeah...i think i love you. completely caught me off guard, i was honest with him. i really like him, but i'm not to that point yet. after a little bit of awkward talking things resume as normal. after an hour or so he suddenly gets really quiet. i'm probably reading way more into that than there is since he fell asleep pretty soon after that, when i finally wake him up and try and get him to move to the bed instead of sleeping on the floor he gets all weird about it. after a little he tells me to just go to bed he'll join me later. so i do. mentally freaking out all the while, but i do. next thing i know my phone is ringing, he went out to get something or other and his clutch slipped and his tires squealed and somehow this is something a cop can pull you over for. now my boyfriend gave himself enough time to sober up before driving, but he still obviously smelled like alcohol. this was a problem. especially since he was driving the company truck. now here's where the real fuck up come's in. as we are hanging up he of course does the usual bye i love you. half asleep scumbag brain decides this is a great time to say i love you too....needless to say he made a big deal, i freaked out and back pedaled that shit out of that, which probably made it worse. this leaves me here. sitting on my couch in a bathrobe, freaking out. he hasn't come home yet, i'm waiting for him to either show up, or to get a call telling me to go pick up the truck because towing companies really hate having to tow their own vehicles....",i'm an idiot and my brain is an asshole when i'm half asleep and i'm probably over thinking everything and freaking out too much.
304,"warning: i'm on a mobile device; expect some errors. so me and my friend have this habit of talking on the phone or in person about the weirdest shit. i'm friends with one of the chefs at ku, where i'm currently at. the other day, my chef friend told me that one of the workers is clinically depressed and is suicidal. fast forward a few days, and me and my friend are in a line. we were discussing our weird shit. my friend tells me  ""hey can i grab the salty sardines out of your dickhole after i fuck your brains out?"" i say, ""okay that's just fucking nasty."" i just realized how loud i said that. i feel a great regret exploding inside me. i see the depressed chef making a pizza, then look at me. i feel extremely bad right now. i don't know what to do.","unintentionally called a pizza ""fucking nasty"" in front of a clinically depressed chef, when i meant it towards my friend."
305,"so right now i'm at a halloween party and i was feeling a little parched, so i ended up on a quest to wet my whistle. i walked in the door from the back yard  and lo-and-behold upon the table is a bowl of freshly made, barely touched, punch. i walk up grab a cup, dunk the ladle and start to pour. as i'm pouring i start to feel a wetness on the back of my hand and hear a dribbling in the bowl. turns out the punch is going down my hand and back into the bowl. i've been petting the dogs since i got here and my hands are less than clean. the kitchen was full but i don't think anyone saw it happen, i feel dirty. everyone is drinking a little ""me tea"" right now. that is all.",went to get a drink ended up a human punch fountain.
306,"a little backstory: i am living in this tiny apartment for a while, and because it is so small the only available space for my pc-tower is a space behind my desk. in order for the cables to reach my tower had to be facing away from me. 

fast forward to today. i am copying about 300gb of data (pictures and stuff mostly) from one drive to another, when i accidentally hit the power switch for my pc with my foot. after powering  back up i notice 2 of my drives are missing from the system overview (2x2tb wd green drives, both of which were pretty full). after a lot of work i have managed to recover about 600gb from one of the drives. still haven't gotten anything good off of the other one yet, although i am still working on it using recuva and testdisk.

here is a recreation of what happened:

307,"i don't know if this is a major fuck-up yet but i decided to post it here anyways.

it starts pretty harmless with me sleeping in my room at around 11:45 am, when suddenly my sister comes bursting in, rudely waking me up and yelling: ""augenmann, get up! lunch is ready!"" i give her the occasional ""i'll be there in a minute"" and wait until she leaves to get up. 

(at this point you gotta know that my grandma often cooks at our house and she live upstairs while my dad, my mum, my sister and i use the bottom floor.)

so basically everyone but me was upstairs and already eating and i had to go relief myself in the bathroom. i decided what the heck, i have enough time, i'll take my phone with me. so i'm standing there with my phone in my hand, reading stuff on reddit. suddenly that little fucker decides to slip outta my fingers and go directly for that pee in the toilet. i noticed the slip but it was too late for my dead-snake-reflexes. it went *sploosh* and all i saw was my phone in a sort of yellow tone. i immediately reach for it in the toilet. get it out, fucker slips again, falls back in. second try, get it out for real, flushed, raced to the sink, disassembled it, washed it with water (i mean, it's just been inside the toilet how bad can it be?)
i then proceed to soak it with water, but hey at least it didn't stink anymore. now i'm sitting here with a wet disassembled phone and i'm totally not gonna try if it works untill i'm sure it's comletely dry again.
update will follow (if i don't forget)","dropped phone into toilet, tried to not make it smell like pee.**"
308,"this happened last night. our relationship started less than 2 weeks before and we  planned to go camping because none of us had in a while. it was amazing, it was just the both of us and we had fires, caught crawdads, had drinks, etc. 
at the end of the drunk night, i accidentally call her by my ex's name and then she just broke. she went off to use the rest room and i left the campsite and went to some unlit backtrail to grasp wtf i had just done. i'm there for a while kicking the sh*t out of myself for being such an idiot. she somehow finds me and gets me to come back to the tent and sleep. we're still together and tell each other we love each other. she's pretty hurt right now and i don't blame her one bit. we are both committed to this relationship and she said she wants to work through this tough patch, we may start at zero again, but for me i would for this girl. 

the thing that makes it even worse is that we have an amazing connection/bond and she really is everything i've ever wanted in a girl. i don't have any feelings for my ex (5 year relationship) at all, she is nothing compared to my current gf, i cut all communication from her and don't regret it one bit. 

 

i hid a bunch of love notes from songs i sing to her around her purse and room, she hasn't seen any/gone home yet. just came back from a bird feeding picnic date with her and will be having a movie date tonight when she's off work. i fucked up bad and she's hurt, but she's still by my side.","at the end of an amazing and romantic camping trip, i called my girlfriend by my ex's name."
309,"so,this morning started off like a normal saturday. i got up, showered, and had breakfast. after consuming my morning meal i decide to watch movies online - and browse reddit of course (shout out to r/motorcycles) - and continue to drink orange juice. a half gallon (1.8l) of delicious goodness to be exact. after the movie i found myself to have a pee boner. 

now, most guys know how hard it can be to pee with an erect pee boner. for the ladies that don't know - it ends up being a guessing game, between the distance and angle of said boner. it is sort of like a water fountain arc, while moving back and forth as the pressure builds and diminishes. it's sort of like a carnival game of sorts.

for whatever reason, i decide just to arc the pee slowly into the sink. as i start everything seems to be going well - as i am pinching the ""hose"" to keep the pressure down. now this is whee things go bad. i start to feel pressure building, then starting to sting/burn. so i let the flow go to max capacity. the stream shots up in the air, and goes on me, and all over the sink and mirror. (insert runaway hose gif here) i peed on myself and all over the sink. don't try to pee in the sink guys.","drank a lot of orange juice, got massive pee boner, decided to pee in sink, went everywhere - including on me"
310,"here's the story.


i've been seeing this guy for about 3 weeks now. he's fantastic and we were really getting along amazingly. 

last night, we were in bed and he was going down on me. we were both very drunk, and my mind was a little fuzzy and distracted. at that moment i apparently decided to softly call out ""oh, james."". i barely even remember doing it as things were getting pretty good downstairs. the man i am seeing is not called james. not even a little bit. 

he immediately stopped what we were doing and got angry and upset. rightfully so. i was too drunk to go home so we spent an awkward night laying next to each other in silence. his angry, mine apologetic. 

before this happened we were approaching a point where we were going to take things a step further and be in a relationship. now, i don't know if i will ever see or hear from him again.

the worst part of all this? the man's name i called out in the heat of the moment was a coworker who i am not even interested in. 

 


edit:

thank you all for your advice and encouragement. he came over and we talked about it. his feelings are still a little hurt but he was very understanding for the most part and has agreed to let the whole thing go. i still feel like an asshole, but as a lot of you have said, accidents happen. thanks again to everyone out there who took time to read my post. you're all great!",called out someone else's name during sex. ruined every chance at a relationship with an amazing guy. name that i called out was just some random dude from work.
311,"**note:** this wasn't today, but last year. upon reading a post here about spilling acetone on some genitals, i was reminded of a night when i screwed up pretty bad. 

i've been a nail biter since i can remember. so every now and then i'll paint my nails to try to elude myself from chewing them off.  

after a night of some nail chewing, the polish i had on got all chipped and gross looking. so, i decided to remove the polish and attempt growing them another day. so i went to bed kinda ticked off on having ended up finger gnawing again. so then i woke up in the middle of the night. now, i usually keep a bottle of water or some kind of drink next to my bed for when i wake up. so my senseless groggy self, instead of picking up the bottle of water, took a nice big gulp of acetone. 

[oh god, ^what ^have ^i ^done?](http://zephotographist.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/i_love_lucy_ricky_shock_gif.gif)

that burn. i ended up spilling it all over my face as well while trying to get the bottle as far away from me as possible. i swear it felt like i had motor-boated a woman made of magma. 

my initial reaction was ""oh fuck, what the hell do i do?!"" so i spit the remainder of it onto the floor, and after running some circles around the apartment thinking what on to do while having a face and mouth made of fire, i got a hold of myself and remembered that i just drank something that could really potentially hurt my insidey parts. time to induce vomiting! *(that was not a good idea)* i only got to witness the burn of a ~~thousand~~ million suns in my mouth and throat again, as my stomach was pretty empty. 

after rinsing my face and mouth for a good 20 minutes to get the sting to go away the best i could, i had to take care of the still intense burning in my mouth. so i drank milk - lots of it. now, i'm very lactose intolerant and we only use homogenized milk in the house. so by the end of the morning not only was my mouth burning, but so was my turd cutter. which mind you; did not cut any turds that day.

312,"i work as a server/manager at a fine dining italian restaurant.  one of our regulars, a barfly really, always told me she wanted to do something with my hair.  i am a guy btw, never put any colour in my hair etc.  our bartender, basically a fuckbuddy of the barfly, repeatedly told me ""yeah, yeah, do it.  she's good! she makes a living cutting hair from home."" finally i give in.  ""sure, i'm growing out my hair a bit, but you can put a few light highlights in my hair to lighten it up.""

the next day i call her up and arrange to meet her at her place.  i arrive, its a ground level apartment.  she greets me, we go inside.  filthy carpet, the tv had what i could only imagine a stream of dried jizz dripped down it.  ""okay"" i think to myself. ""she does this for a living, its all good.""  she takes me to her ""chair"".  it was literally a broken down lawn chair. ""fuck! i can't even back out of this now."" i sit down, she pulls out a tube of something and a plastic fork.  she gets to work.  my head is feeling heavy at this point.  i reiterate to her that all i wanted was some nice blending in highlights.  ""oh yeah! i totally understand.  don't worry! i know what i'm doing!"".  i'm basically shitting myself at this point in time.  she throws a plastic shopping bag on my head and has me sit there.  i start frantically texting my fiancee. ""what the fuck did i do?"" ""why did i do this?!?""  finally she comes back.  ""time to rinse it out!"" we enter her bathroom.  she had me kneel beside her filthy toilet and put my head under the tap in her bathtub.  at this point all i can think of is ""get this shit off of my head! i don't even care that i'm kneeling beside her disgusting toilet!""  she appraises her job and decides she need to put more bleach or whatever on.  keep in mind i am yet to see a mirror.  ""its okay, i'm sure it's..."" i feel more bleach on my head. ""fuck!"" okay, bag, rinse, repeat.  she's done! she shows me the final job.  i want to die.  giant chunks of white blonde at the front (i have a don draper like 50's style to my hair) throughout the rest, orangey blonde, dark blonde, white blonde, any colour of blonde you can imagine.  and she is looking at me, with a look of insane pride on her face. ""do you love it? omg! it looks amaaaaazing!""  all i could say was ""umm, its neat.""  she asks for $25.  i leave.  i look for the hidden cameras.  no luck, this actually happened, i wasn't on candid camera or anything.

i get one block away and call a coworker.  luckily i had a hat with me.  i ask her to meet me, i need to show her something and i need her to tell me i'm overreacting.  we meet up.  i take off the hat.  she bursts out laughing. ""who did this to you??? why did you let it happen??""  we make an emergency appointment with her hairdresser.  i get there, she looks at me, holding back laughter and says ""did you lose a bet or something?"" followed with ""wow, she must really hate you.""  she matched my original colour, puts the dye in, we let it sit. 3 times we had to do that as the dye wouldn't hold.  i can't wash my hair for like a month or this will wash out and i'll have a head of fucked up blonde chunks. and now i have to break this shitty hairdressers heart when she comes in the restaurant next.

313,"as a group of friends and me were about to go to class, i decided to grab a cup of water before we left.  i have a nalgene bottle that i usually take, but for some reason i really wanted a styrofoam cup of ice water.  the desks in the classroom are standard college desks, which are pretty small.  enough room for a laptop or a notebook and textbook, but not much else.  i take notes on my laptop, and decided to set the cup on the edge of my desk.  i'm a pretty careful person, and also kind of overly protective with my electronics (i.e. phone, laptop, game systems), so i knew that *i* wouldn't spill the cup; i didn't take my friend sitting in front of me into account.  he turned around to ask me a quick question, his elbow hit my cup, and i watched in utter horror as water doused my keyboard.  i immediately jumped out of my chair and yelled, ""shit-fuck!""  the professor and everyone in the class -- about 65 students -- were staring at me with a mixture of faces.  some chucking, but most just flat out confused.  all i could muster was, ""he.  the water.  and, laptop?  i-i have to go.""  i grabbed my backpack and got the fuck out of dodge.

314,"so my bike was already giving me some problems, however since i am not mechanically inclined i had no idea what was wrong with it and figured it would be fine till i got home.

both of my roommates work at the local head shop thats right on the main strip of my town. on my way home i stopped by the shop to pick up this pipe i had been eyeing for awhile. i parked out back, went in grabbed the pipe, and broke it in with the boys in the basement. 

fast-foward. shop's closing and we are all headed out; this is when the trouble starts. the bikes not starting and i have no idea what to do. at this point it's too late to actually call someone, so i decide to just push it in the backdoor and leave it inside for the night. now it's not that i lived in a bad area and was worried about it being stolen, but rather i live in a college town where it wouldn't surprise me for some drunk asshole to just walk by and push it over. either way the decision was made to push it inside, go on with the night, and figure it out in the morning.

now, i am not a morning person at all so i just planned on going back to the shop a few hours after they open. this way i had time to sleep in then maybe get some breakfast. 

so i'm at home sleeping and my phone starts ringing and i'll usually silence my phone at least once before i'm actually awake, so it usually takes a few straight calls if you want to get ahold of me first thing in the morning. 

i finally wake up and answer my roommate's call and he is not happy. he starts yelling at me telling me how the whole shop smells like gas and how i needed to get down and clean everything up. the neighboring businesses had already called the gas company and local authorities. i immediately get up and head into town stopping on the way for some supplies. apparently white vinegar works pretty well on cleaning up  the smell of gas. i arrive at the shop only to realize it wasn't just a little gas and that my entire gas tank has emptied into the store. it took me several hours to get it all cleaned up but we didn't have to deal with any cops. not having to explain myself or interact with police at all was a huge plus on account of them making me extremely nervous. we basically just played dumb to the other businesses once i had it cleaned up. saying things like ""oh i don't know but it's definitely going away"" the gas company people sent someone out but that was clearly just to satisfy the other businesses. the guy came checked the electric meters and was on his way. as for the gas less bike i just had a tow truck come pick it up and take it to the repair shop. needless to say i won't be parking indoors for a bit",motorcycle broke down. parked it in store. gas leaked everywhere. other business though it was a natural gas leak so called authorities

i guess i was so caught up in my awe of the collective story that i forgot about some of the not-so-minor details. i didn't shit myself today luckily, r/tifu, but this clean up might take longer.

**",** -reminded girlfriend of her shitty past and potentially gave her new anxieties.
316,"so, let me just preface this by saying, i'm fine this happens occasionally.

i woke up this morning around 8am, my hubs had said last night he wanted to sleep in this morning so he could stay up later tonight to watch football (go chiefs!) so i let him rest while i laid in bed finishing a book i had started and surfing around on reddit for a bit. when i tried to get up to go pee i had quite a solid case of vertigo and bounced off the wall a few times getting to the toilet. i didn't think anything of it, like i said it happens. around noon, i wake him up to go get some breakfast and some snack supplies for the game. 

he apparently woke up frisky, so he rolled over and started fingering me. vertigo be damned, i am not turning down a frisky hubs. i let him continue for a few minutes, enjoying the attention. he sits up to reposition himself and i take that opportunity to give him a little mouth hug. in the process of sitting up too quickly (i know better than to do that when i'm already dizzy, i'm a nurse, yada yada) the room started spinning again. i, not being deterred from wanting to get some morning action, proceeded to go to town on his dick. no problem so far. i start to try to seductively slip off my panties and that's where i fucked up. 

the room spun, i fell over sideways (not sexy) and i ended up with a muscle cramp from the odd way i landed tangled up in my lacy undies. me being my usual graceful and sexy self ended up in a complete giggle fit, like i was a 12 year old girl. that really was the end my getting any dick this morning.  my husband, god love him, is just watching the stumbilina olympics going on by his man bits, hoping i don't flail into him and take him down with me. at this point i have to just give up on getting lucky and just take care of him. at least we both had a good laugh and one of us got off. 

he still hasn't stopped laughing about the scene i made this morning. 

 

edit: minus words",i tried to hop a ride on some morning wood and fell off.
317,"today has not been a good day, and it's only 1:30.

as i slept, at 9:30, i was having a wonderful dream. i don't remember anything about it, other than it was really enjoyable.

then, my alarm interrupted me.

groaning, i sat up, looking blearily at the time, and muttered something offensive to alarm clocks. reaching out, i grabbed my can of brand-non-specific cola soft drink from last night and gave it a shake. awesome, still some in there, a nice pick-me-up to start the day. 

i take a sip, and frown. this isn't right. it's granular. since when was coke granular. spitting it out into my hand, i'm horrified to find ants. dozens of them. crying out in shock, i fling them off my hand, about the room, and begin to spit everywhere, trying to get the little buggers out of my mouth. panting and heaving a little, i sit on my bed, surveying the formician carnage, and think, ""fuck this, i'm taking a piss.""

so, i take a sojourn across to the bathroom, lift the seat and let loose the torrents. unfortunately, i forgot that i had just woken up, and neglected to sit down, and part of me had been awake for quite some time. inevitably, this lead to trouble aiming, and so there was some splashback, which proceeds to get all over my legs. well, fuck.

it is now 9:40. i get a call from a recruiter asking me if i was on my way to a job interview i had scheduled for the day. wait, what do you mean, am i on my way? i thought the interview was at 2pm! but no, it was at 10am, bugger it all. okay, so i rush around, coke- and piss-spattered, to clean up a little and put a suit on, phoning a taxi to pick me up (because busses are far too slow, and i don't have the money for a car), and it's that point that my body decides to inform me of having strained every usable muscle in my torso and right arm from playing tetherball with a housemate the day before. so i am now hobbling and groaning down the phone at a taxi company, trying to pull a suit over my aching body. however, godsend, the taxi arrives without incident and i get there in fairly good time.

10:15. not too bad. 25 minutes late, by my standards (nice and early, nice and eager, after all). the interview begins, and suddenly i have no english. i can't remember what i'm qualified in, what experience i have, who i've worked for, where i grew up, my name, my age, nothing. all gone. mind is blank. i struggle through the interview with a few prompts, and get out the other side 40 minutes later relatively unscathed, though my confidence on that position is shot. i decide to get a little retail therapy, and hop on over to my local mtg shop (shoutout to /r/magictcg ).

while i'm there, i get a phone call from the recruiter, berating me for being late. of course, he doesn't know about the rest of the morning, and i can hardly tell him, but that's not his problem. so, i kiss ass to get through that particular conversation, and arrange another meeting with them for another round of interviewing on monday. it is now noon. i have had enough of today already, and head home to type this saga up.","tifu by drinking ants, pissing on my own legs, destroying my body with a children's garden toy and almost fucking up a job interview, all before lunchtime."
318,"so i'm trying to eat a little healthier.  today i stopped at an asian supermarket, mostly to look around.  i spotted some dieter's green tea, and i remembered that someone had recommended it to me a while back, so i picked some up.  i ran some errands with the hubby, and a few hours later when we got home, i decided to try some.

that was at about 3:30 this afternoon.  it's now 11 pm, and i've already spent some time in the bathroom emptying my bowels of the nastiest, smelliest feces with a consistency that ranges from watery to 'fruit on the bottom' yogurt.  my stomach is still cramping, my sphincter is on fire, and my guts are making ominous rumbling sounds.  i fear i will be spending more time in the bathroom.

this is all because i didn't read the labels on the damn box.  i checked it after my bathroom adventures, and found the culprit.  there was a [hint](http://i.imgur.com/d5p5uzmh.jpg) on the box, and on the other side, a [notice](http://i.imgur.com/a0swbeoh.jpg).","senna tastes gross, and honey does not help."
319,"this is for a course in one of my last semesters of college and it ends probably today.

to make a long story short, the project required us to also hand in a user manual to go with the project directly by hand to the professor. i never got this memo and left it in the professor's physical office inbox. i'm just goddamn hoping the professor lets me turn the physical copy in tomorrow morning. holy fuck i need a drink and knowing where i stand as far as scholarships and gpa stands, this might end up being a $5,000.00 mistake. i want to die and i need a stiff drink.",there isn't a tl;dr for this i think i just want to shoot myself for a mistake this fucking huge. i fucking suck.
320,"okay, i remember a couple of days ago we had a thread asking people to describe the laziest thing they have ever done. mine might not quite measure up to a captain shifting a navy ship to get the sun out of his eyes, but it's pretty damn awful.

a couple of weeks back, i saved up my hard-earned money and bought myself a sex toy to celebrate my 18th birthday. it was a fleshlight, and i waited eagerly for its delivery for a week before it actually came. when it arrived, i rushed upstairs with it, tore off the packaging and eagerly prepared to plunge my brave little astronaut into its rubbery depths. there were a few problems on entry, but with a touch of lube my fleshlight and i quickly established a working relationship.

once i was done, i sealed up my evidence, curled up in faux post-coital bliss, and went to sleep. the fleshlight lay by my bed faithfully until i woke up, at which point my mum was around the house again and i was confronted with the pressing need to hide it. i shoved it into a drawer and tried my best to forget about it. for two weeks, every time i thought about cleaning it, i would just comfort myself with the idea that it probably wasn't too bad and the quality of the toy was good enough that it wouldn't be too much of a problem. it sounds stupid, i know, but i would need the twin benefits of experience and hindsight before i would see exactly how idiotic i had been.

two weeks later, i opened it up again to be confronted with one of the most impressive collections of mold i have ever seen. the thing had a distinctly unpleasant odor and the mold had grown in little patches all over the face of the toy, and had taken root in the material itself, making any attempt to clean it an exercise in futility. i'm now confronted with the prospect of having to ditch a once-used, £59 fleshlight, and just wank with my hand again like a normal person.","bought expensive toy, used it once, was too lazy to clean, toy became home to a flourishing mold colony."
321,"recently, during the height of breast cancer awareness month (sorry, not technically today), i was over at my girlfriend's house energetically pregaming for a night out. needless to say, my brain-to-mouth filter wasn't in full working condition.
she was showing me around her house when we ran into one of her roommates, a very sweet girl who happened to be heading up their sorority's ribbon sale to raise money for breast cancer awareness/research. when i noticed a box of said ribbons on her floor, ""sophie"" (her roommate) asked if i'd buy one. i happily agreed, but not before making an offhand comment to the effect of ""yes, as long as you're not working with those bastards at the susan g. komen foundation!"" you see, i had recently read [this tread detailing what a dishonest organization susan g. komen is](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1oavtl/til_the_ceo_of_susan_g_komen_for_the_cure_makes/). sophie looked confused, so i barreled on, explaining the dismal percentage of proceeds that the company gives to actual research, and how grossly overpaid their executives are. as i neared the end of my smug diatribe, sophie burst into tears and ran out of the room.
turns out her mom is pretty high up with susan g. komen, and i apparently shattered her glowing perception of the company and her mom's work. in the end, it was probably something she needed to hear, but i sure wished i hadn't made her cry by explaining it so aggressively.",keeping it real went wrong.**
322,"i just recently got out of a bad relationship. she was 24[f] i am 26[m]. she was super neurotic and talked down to me the whole time. i was no saint either though. i lied to her, a lot. i never really showed her the real me. she was hot, and i was into it really because of that. i am shallow i know. i honestly never thought the relationship would last very long at all. but it was fun while it did. 

at the time of my infidelity, she and i weren't officially dating. in that she did not think of me as her boyfriend, and i didn't really think of her as my girlfriend. we had slept together, but she was on the fence about me from the get-go (we didn't make anything official until october, and even then it wasn't long before the fights started). we started seeing each other in july, and i cheated in september. i was drunk at a hotel, she was out of town. there was a girl there who i knew had a thing for me, and she was coming onto me very strong. i cracked, and slept with her that night in her hotel room. i feel horrible about it, and it was by far the worst thing i have ever done. it was so very not worth it. 

where i fucked up was that i just recently, like 2 days ago, found out that my now ex has moved on and is in a new relationship. now normally i am very good with getting over girls. but seeing that, i snapped. i wanted her to hurt, just like how i was hurting. i had developed real feelings for her and she broke my heart. so i was determined to break hers. this is out of character for me, i told her about the drunken romp with a floozy back in september. i did it because i knew that that was the only ammo i had left in my gun that i knew would hurt her. 

i also told her that i believe that she pulled a pregnancy scare on me on purpose (she was two weeks late after we broke up) just to fuck with me. i don't honestly believe that, but i said it because again, i wanted to hurt her. 

i feel like a monster. i feel so bad about it, and how i handled it. she does not want to see me or speak to me ever again. i do not blame her. after what i did, i don't deserve her respect. i honestly feel like i don't respect myself enough to really respect anyone else. i think i need to get help. 

i just wanted to get that shit off of my chest. thank you if you read all of this.","i fucked around on my now ex girlfriend, and told her just to spite her and hurt her. i feel horrible, but i can't take it back."
323,"not today, but i digress. i am really into film making and thought it would be a great idea to incorporate my passion into my eagle service project, not just make another damn bench. what i chose to do was make short psa videos for a local elementary school about what kids should do in emergency situations. it was a fun, creative idea, and i thought it would be a breeze because it is something i like doing. 
    so i spend months planning and completing paperwork, getting approval and such before i started the actual filming process, but the day finally rolls around. i brought a ton of equipment and a crew, and things are going better than expected. we film in 2 less days than i planned for and i was excited to transfer the footage so that i could begin editing. i thanked all the people who helped me and went home to my computer and slid the sdhc card into the reader i had bought that same day for $10. do not trust a $10 card reader.
      the card randomly ejects during the transfer process and i lose every bit of footage i had. but that's not it. disbelief turned into panic and i called a local tech repair store to ask if anything could do to save my project. they told me i could try a data recovery service, and see if they could retrieve my footage. i immediately drive to the nearest one, about an hour away, and pay the fee of $250. i was mad as hell, but thought, ""if i get the project back, it'll be worth every penny."" i leave the place pissing myself with anxiety, but hoping for the best.
     for 4 days i wait for them to contact me, and they finally did. they said they were successful and had the footage on a usb drive they would give to me for an extra $10. fuck it, i need the files. i pay the damn fee and get home and run to my computer faster than a kid on christmas morning and plug in the usb.
     there are 3 audio files. not my video, but an old school project. and even if i was looking for that, i couldn't use it. i call up the place and demand a refund, and they say i paid for the effort, not the result. so i'm down tons of work and $260. hoping to try again soon...","eagle scout film project gets destroyed due to shitty sd card reader, then i pay $260 to try and get it back, and i don't. no refund."
324,"some background:
the windows in my house are sealed around the sides with duct tape to prevent unnecessary drafts.  it's an old historic house and it gets very cold. 

the story:

i was boiling some water on my stovetop to make pasta, but when i went to put the pasta in, i dropped a handful of it all over the stovetop and floor. i went to grab a broom, and got distracted my roommates, so when i returned to the stove a few minutes later, a long piece of pasta which had fallen into the burner had caught fire. in fact, it burned all the way down, off the stove, and by the time i returned to the kitchen, it had set my paper towels on fire. 

i opened the window and threw the paper towels out into the snow, but inadvertently set the duct tape on the window frame on fire as well. i panicked, and my roommate came running to the kitchen. he screamed as though he was a 9-year-old girl.  fortunately, i thought to grab the detachable sprayer from our sink and quenched the fire before it spread too far. 

the damage isn't bad. nothing structural, just cosmetic. my pasta burned though :-(  now i'm still hungry.","set my house on fire, roommate screams like a girl, i'm still hungry,"
325,"so this morning i followed my usual schedule by grabbing a bowl of granola with soy milk and trudging on over to the couch to watch some tv. i look over and my 17 pound, monster of a [cat](http://imgur.com/djzjn.jpg), obie, is just chillin there lookin all cute. in my early morning groggy state i thought it would be a fun idea to have him sit on my lap while i ate my breakfast. i snapped my fingers and was flopped upon by this beast. now, when he sits on me he takes up my *whole* lap making movement difficult. i tried to readjust myself so that he'd fit more comfortably which is when the fuck up started. next thing i know, the bowl is upside down on his back; i have no recollection of it falling, just the horror as he practically shat bricks. i probably sat there for a solid two minutes trying to understand what had just happened before deciding how to proceed. i was wearing my bf's sweatshirt and didn't want to get cereal all over it so for my next fuck up, i thought ""gee, i'll just let him jump off me himself."" wrong. granola went flying. i mean it was *everywhere*. i grabbed him at arms length, flung him onto the kitchen table, and found some paper towels. cleaning up taught me two valuable lessons:
1, granola *will* get tangled in long fur/hair
and 2, soy milk dries incredibly sticky.
he's all good now except for a little bit of matted fur. but yeah, i fucked up.","got granola all over my cat, was stupid enough to let him jump off me sending cereal in all directions, and just discovered more sticky fur**"
326,"let me start by saying that this has happened with the most kindest intentions...


well my drum major was looking up costumes for next year's marching show ( which is lord of the rings... winning) and was talking about it on facebook. so being the funny guy i am i comment, and after a while a few other people comment on it and along comes this guy.. now.. he's been being a douche to her and calling her names like bitch and such..... and i've known about this for a couple months now... and my amazing brain comes up with the idea' hey man, why don't you call him an orc!!!!!"" and i'm like "" fuck yeah brain that's a great idea!!!!!""
and so.....

i posted it ... but no sooner than after i posted it the guy likes and it then i realize...... oh shit i just called her an orc.....
so i texted her to let her know that i wasn't calling her one and she's fine with it and said its okay..... but damn... ive been fucking up all day...",called my drum major an orc on facebook for all to see...
327,"around one year ago i was looking for work in the sound engineering/music area, so i decided it would be a good idea to register a domain name with my full name to make myself look more professional to employers. so i go ahead and register with uk2.net, ""myfullname.com"".

it gets a little technical here, but is relevant to the fuckup.

the thing is that i already had my own hosting, with a vps provider. i pointed the domain name to the ip address for my server, but i didn't have a website made yet. so i set up my server to redirect the url to my soundcloud, at least for the time being.

i put the url onto my cv and sent it out to prospective employers.

not too long after that, i found myself a job, forgot about the website and figured i would just let the domain expire. i also switched to another host, and didn't bother to setup the redirect again. so the url wasn't doing anything, as far i knew.

cue back to today. i get an email from uk2 to tell me my domain is due for renewal. curious, i open up the url again ""myactualfullname.com"". and what comes up? a picture of a guy pissing on another guy's face. another picture of a guy being fisted while wearing leather bondage. ""gay fisting, leather and pissing"" in the title bar. yep, my ""professional"" url was directing to a gay porn site.

it turns out the ip address of my old server had been reinstated as the ip for a server hosting a porn site.

i quickly logged into uk2 and swapped the dns servers back to defaults again and deleted the entries on the dns server i was using. but anyone who understands this kind of stuff will tell you it can take a day or so before records get updated across the world. as of writing this, it still points to that site..

i have no idea how long it has been like that. potentially a few months to half a year. i really hope no one found a copy of the cv i sent out in the past and decided to look it up..","unintentionally hosted gay porn on my professional website, put the url on my cv and sent it out to potential employers**"
328,"today was like any other day. i got home from school and went straight to the toilet to take a shit. my diet for the past week hasn't been the best so my shit wasn't the normal consistency. i finished my business and proceeded to wipe my ass this is when the problem started. 
 
   i could get rid of all the fucking shit. 3o wipes later and more than 3 flushes. i would still get a brown stain on my tissue roll when i wipe. i got pissed of and just proceeded to pull up my boxers, wash my hands and leave.

  for the next 35 minutes the rampant smell of shit lingered in my nose. at first i tried to ignore it then it just became to annoying to ignore. i went back to the toilet and proceeded to wipe like 12 more times and still the fucking brown stain is there i thought it must be coming from my boxers but it's still it's normal red colour. i pull up my boxers and yet the smell is still there. 

 i wanted to get rid of the smell  so i grab a can on lynx final edition, spread my ass cheeks and spray it up there. worst decision ever. it felt like hades had been let loose in my ass. it felt like i got sucker punched up the ass by kimbo slice. 

 i fucking killed. my ass felt like it was ripping apart. i had to walk for the rest of the day in a weird arched position limping to minimize the pain. 
 
  at least it got rid of the smell.",sprayed lynx up my ass to get rid of smell. ass felt like it was being ripped apart.
329,"we had a bad storm go through here a couple of days ago, winds knocked down several trees, which of course had to be cleaned up today. 

our family has a system for this (with 40 acres this happens often). my dad runs the chainsaw and i help him however i can - pulling on branches while he's cutting, pulling stuff out of the way of the saw, moving limbs he's already cut, etc. my mom and daughters and whoever else is there drag everything to the burn pile. either my husband or my son mans the pile and keeps the fire going. it's a fairly efficient system. 

so today i was doing my normal job and my dad asked me to pull on a limb as he was cutting it. normally he'll only cut if we can see each other, mainly to make sure all of our various appendages stay attached. this limb was over my head and i couldn't see him so i didn't know when the branch was free. instead of falling like it was supposed to it hit me in the mouth. there was blood and ouch. fuck up #1. 

i got cleaned up and we went to cut another tree down. it was about as big around as my leg. dad gave me instructions: 

what i heard: grab this branch and pull so it falls this direction (what i'd been doing all day).

what he actually said: grab this branch and run like hell when the tree starts falling. 

i grab the branch, the chainsaw runs, i see him get through the tree, it starts falling and the next thing i know i'm bleeding in many places. 

the tree was a honey locust tree.... aka [thorny locust] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honey_locust). go look at the pic... i'll give you a minute. 

yep. thorns everywhere. the thorns aren't just on the trunk of the tree - they are on the branches right out to the tips of the little twigs. and they're not all little thorns. most of them are 1"" plus in length. 

my face, neck, arms, stomach and legs are all scratched up, some fairly deep. fuck up #2. 

and you know what? i think that's enough clean up for today. stay tuned and see how i fuck up tomorrow!",didn't pay attention to my dad while he was wielding the chainsaw. took a branch to the mouth. also learned what a thorny locust tree is - ended up bleeding in multiple places.
330,"so, this wasn't really today, but it was about a 3 months ago. a friend on skype was reading post on this sub-reddit aloud and i thought i should share my story after hearing the[ post about a fart traveling up some poor lady's vagina at work.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1j0ybg/tifu_by_trusting_a_fart/) anyways, that's enough babbleing. here's my horror story.

 i hadn't been feeling well, thought it was gas. like many people here i made a huge mistake. trusted a fart. so, it came out as  small diarrhea fart. not that bad right?

 just keep reading. 

i was sitting when it happened and as i stood i felt another coming on. and i thought i could make it too the bathroom seeing as it was like 10-20 feet away. so, i clench my butt cheeks and waddled to the bathroom and here it came. i sharted a big, runny, diarrhea shart, and then it did the weird bubble thing where it traveled to front of my underwear and it was all in my vagina and it was sticky and gross and i just ran crying to my bathroom. luckily no one was home. it was a pain in the ass to clean.   
so, there's my story. never told anyone until now of course. mainly because i did my best to forget it.

331,"background: i work for an events company doing sound/lighting/video. hours can be horrendous with little thanks from the client. it's not glamourous.


so last week (sorry, not today!) we had a fairly big catwalk show for a major fashion label. 12 minute show, think £20,000 a minute for the finished job. it's in an old warehouse venue because they like it all edgy and industrial.


we're loading in at 10pm after working a full day in the office, when the guys loading out the event before us mention there's two pallets of [starbucks mocha frappucino](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iamufxef5pe/tikf_zwoz4i/aaaaaaaahgw/tmjcyzvd2i0/s1600/frap.jpg) drinks left over if we'd like them. there's 20 of us, so i happily said yes. sickly sweet and milky but hell, it's free!!


come 10pm the next day and having worked the past 36 hours, i've sunk about 3 boxes (10 bottles per box) of the suckers and eaten twice. stupidly busy, running around and lifting things so i keep on downing the little fuckers. by 6am we're rehearsing and i'm on box number 4...


the show was due to start at 3pm and i'm still not feeling tired. at half 2, i decide to go for a quick pre-show dump in the venue's crappy hired portaloos. i managed to get my trousers halfway down before my guts decide i have to poop out 40 crappy caffienated milk drinks now, no exceptions. imagine putting a firework in a tub of molten chocolate...there's poop all over the walls, floor, and trousers. there was even a turd-deflection from toilet seat onto toilet paper holder.


i'm there in horror for a few seconds before i go into damage control mode and take of my trousers, then reach for the toilet roll...covering my hands in poop. i decided the best idea at this point was to leave the destroyed portaloo and go to the one next door, half naked and covered in poop. through some miracle no-one saw me and long story short, i managed to get myself cleaned up double-quick before someone radioed me...""right, positions people, we're going on in 5, call off"". lighting, video, followspot ops all call in but i'm still outside covered in poop smears. forgot to mention i was running sound for this...


i realised i'd left my trousers in the other cubicle. panicing that i'd lose the client's job by fucking up the show, i legged it out the cubicle and grabbed a drape, wearing it like a turd-smelling skirt.


i managed to play off the drape-skirt as a joke (people frequently mix bottomless for shits and giggles), and no-one questioned the smell. however, i still haven't heard to this day what happened to the poor sod who found my shitty trousers in the portaloo.","drank 40 mochas, splashed turd all over a portaloo, had to work wearing a curtain as a skirt."
332,"so i'm a firefighter and we are on scene of a supposed electrical fire (false alarm) and i'm standing in a door way with another firefighter as instructed to do. now just before the alarm went off another firefighter was in the shower. when the tone dropped he comes down in his underwear and puts his gear on (pretty funny). so as we are standing in the door way i start talking to the other guy about it saying did you see ""firefighter blah"" running down stairs in his underwear lol, only to realize that my mic on my radio was caught in my air pack and was keyed up so everyone could hear what i was saying. so yeah, tifu and i got a stern talk from a superior.","radio keyed up, underwear, everyone heard, stern talk"
333,"wasn't last night but it was the following night. 

so my friends and i went to mayhem fest to see rob zombie and fiver finger death punch. well the kids i went with like to smoke weed and one of them brought half an o along. i didn't know this and we were half way there when he whipped it out. i don't smoke and i don't care being around it.

all was good at the concert had a blast and told my friend i'd drive her car home so she can sleep. it is like 11am when we left and a 3 three hour drive home.

what i didn't know was the car was unsuspected with a tail light out...
this screams pull me over and that is exactly what happens. we were 30 mins from being home and i see cop lights go off. 

the officer come up asks us where we were at and informed me about the light being out. he then asks me to step out and get on the side of the road. he is being all buddy buddy with me ask about the concert then says, ""i smell weed.""

at this point i know we are fucked. the weed was sitting in the car all day in 90 degree heat cooking up the stench of the bud. i am asked if i smoked any. i did not due to i dont have a need for it and having bad anxiety. apparently to him my eyes say different, no one smoked in the car at all.

i then get handcuffed brought to jail, not a police station jail. the whole time i am sober, but they don't believe me. so i have to get a blood test there, woo first time for that, and get my mug shot/finger prints taken.

they placed me in a holding cell for two hours till my dad picked me up. this all lasted from 2am-5am. now i have to wait two weeks for my blood test to come negative so i don't get a dui.

fuck that night,","friends had bud, got pulled over and cops accused me of being high when i was sober the whole time. handcuffed and sent to jail for 3 hours."
334,"i was out. walking. it was crowded. i was going down the street when a mother stopped in the middle of the block to pick her kid up, i was walking right behind them and had to do some reggie bush shit to make sure i didn't topple over them. so now i'm on the end of the sidewalk, and trying to maneuver my way out of a crowd. a woman and her boyfriend walk right past me, and my only way out is to walk between them. so i do. and they don't stop. she walks right into me, and my arm/chest rub right up against her breast. i felt immediately awkward, and i could feel the boyfriend had stopped and was watching me. they thought i did it purposely, or at least he did. 


so fast forward 10 minutes. i'm in a totally different area. walking, minding my own business. i look to the other side of the street and see the same couple walking. immediately i say to myself ""ahh fuck"". so i figure just keep walking. i did nothing wrong, not intentionally at least. i put my head down and start walking. i get a few steps forward and look up, and see the boyfriend just standing on the other side watching me, pretty threateningly. now i'm in full fight mode. i just keep walking, and i could see the girlfriend kinda holding the bf back because she obviously knows it was an accident. i keep walking, trying to avoid a fight over brushing a boob. i get to the end of the block, cross, and that was it.

**",- almost got attacked because i accidentally hit some guys girlfriends breast. was awkward for all involved**.
335,"to give a bit of background, i haven't slept since sunday because my job is a wee bit demanding at the moment. i recently moved to a new duty station and today is day 3 of my new job. on monday, i had to cover a 24 hour duty shift for a colleague. this bled into my normal job on tuesday. this is not uncommon, and i would normally have just caught up on my sleep tuesday night. but not this time. tuesday would be another sleepless night, as i had to return to work early that night for some training in a simulator (a giant video game in a small, mobile, sealed container... this detail is important). at this point, i have been on duty for roughly 48 hours, working tirelessly with another 24 hours to go before i could possibly get any sleep. the only way i have been able to cope up to this point was by self medicating with anything and everything available at my local 7/11. the human body has its limits. at a certain point, it will revolt. the following is a message sent to my brother detailing my untimely shitastrophe: 

the overwhelming nausea that ensued a record-pace consumption of a monster energy drink was only a foreshadowing of the catastrophe to follow. a mere 30 minutes into the simulation, my gunner became frightened by the sound of what he mistook for a buffalo stampede. his error in judgment was only confirmed by the noxious smell of what i assume is my own gi track dissolving itself in the corrosive cocktail of energy drinks, coffee, caffeine pills and a gas station hot dog. to liken it to a normal bout of flatulence would be like comparing a double homicide with the holocaust. imagine the entire cast of bambi simultaneously processed through a wood chipper into a large metal vat and left to stew in a hot parking lot for three days. now we're getting close. one could use the same metaphor to roughly describe the bowel movement that followed. i'm still unsure if it was fecal matter exiting my sphincter at mach 2 or just the remnants of what my colon used to be.

needless to say, eye contact is still a bit dodgy...

[",] today i discovered my body's limit for ingestion of energy supliments. professional relationships irreparably destroyed... along with a perfectly good uniform
336,"tonight i was coming home from a friend's house after a fun night of gta v (not relevant to the story, but still a super fun game) and i was approaching a stoplight and my eyes tricked me into thinking the light was green when it was actually red. luckily i didn't crash, unluckily there was a cop car sitting at the light and he instantly pulled me over. now i have a $120 citation. ffffuuu","colorblindness leads me to run a red light, cop pulls me over and gives me a $120 citation."
337,"i'm posting this here in the hope i will never forget it...

recently i've been really turned on by the thought of anal pleasure, i had gone in just a little but not much and always cleaned up after not even knowing if i had to. maybe i should have googled this... it would have saved me the trouble i went through today, it really was not nice.

so last night is when it happened, i applied some lube and went at it with my fingers, i decided to go a little deeper than usual and damn it felt so good! i felt like i was in heaven, like i had something to live for, when i finally came there was loads. 

you can call me weird but i like to sit upside down and ejaculate into my own mouth, i can say i've done weirder, i can get my mouth part way down my penis which i sometimes do and i'd do it all the time if i didn't ache so much the next day, saves explaining why i need to bath at 4am in the morning as although im 18, i still live with my parents. i feel this had an effect on me in the sense that i didn't think of cleaning up at the other end.

i didn't sleep that night, i currently am having sleeping issues and need to get checked for insomnia, well i completely forgot about the lube still all the way in my ass. i went to uni at my normal time, it wasn't until i was in my lecture that i realized my ass seemed wet of some kind, after the lecture i headed to the toilets and saw my worst nightmares... i really shouldn't have ate a fucking curry, it was starting to leak and the idiot that i am, i didn't even think of pooping as i don't like public toilets, it seriously didn't come to mind :(

i thought it was only a little so i held out for the rest of the day, im not sure whether or not it was poop and at the time i hadn't even remembered about the lube. fast forward to arriving at home, i rushed to the toilet and had the easiest most painless poop ever, thats when i realized why. i had forgot to clean up the lube inside my ass and as a result my briefs or whatever they are called were covered in shit. 

it definitely felt good at the time but after this experience im definitely going to remember to clean up afterwards with wipes or something, im not sure if thats a good idea i will for sure research it. i don't fancy slowly letting out wet poop for 6 hours again... 

any advice on anything else i should know would be useful, i don't want to make any other mistakes.","stuck my fingers up my rear end forgetting to clean up the lube afterwards, next day poop slowly slid out, had easy shit but messed up my boxers... never again, well the leaving the lube part of course..."
338,"this actually happened a few weeks ago, but i found out the truth about him last night...

i work at a safe house for victims of domestic violence.  it's a women- and children-only shelter and it's a transitional 60-day program.  i also monitor the domestic violence hotline while working my shifts, and i received a call last month from a man calling from the local er with a fractured shoulder looking for a safe place to stay.

he told me that his wife had pushed him down the stairs after threatening him repeatedly, and that the abuse was on-going but he was ready to leave her.  i did an intake with him over the phone, and called my supervisor to get permission to put him up in a hotel for the night, which she gave.

i picked him up from the er and drove him across town to the hotel.  he was a very positive guy, late-50's and an ex-youth pastor who had worked with americorps and other organizations.  he told me that the police had not been very kind to him, asking why he hadn't defended himself, and he said because he would never hit his wife.  i felt for him because this is a common attitude that male dv victims face, and i told him that he had done the right thing and assured him that we would help him reach a safe place.  he was a pretty small guy, and came off as quiet and honest, and i felt genuinely bad for him.

the next day, i picked him up from the hotel and took him to his town's police station so that he could get a police escort to collect his things from his house (standard procedure).  the police had us wait almost a half hour before speaking with us even though it was a sunday morning and we were the only ones in the station (small town).  when the two cops finally did come out, they asked what the situation was, and i explained it.  they looked at each other, and then one asked the man if there was a restraining order against him.  i thought that this was a display of the pervasive and dangerous attitude that men can't be victims, and told them that *he* had been assaulted, he hadn't been the abuser.

i knew one of the cops, so we chatted for a couple minutes about hometown stuff, then they took the man in the squad car and left, and i went back to finish my shift at the shelter.

the man ended up staying in the hotel for three nights before being able to contact family in ohio and deciding to drive down there to stay with them.  he called the hotline again to thank me for all of my help, and expressed genuine gratitude for the concern and caring that i showed him.  my agency paid for the hotel stay and gave him money to get out of state, all based on my reports and logs of the event.

last night, while talking with my supervisor, she told me that he had actually been abusing his wife for over three years, and she had pushed him down the stairs in self-defense.  the police had left a message with another department of our agency outlining the entire situation and the wife's statement, letting us know that she might call for sheltering or support services.  the information was never relayed to any of the shelter staff, and i fell for all of his bullshit.

i cost my agency over $300 (which is a lot for a non-profit), and helped a violent and manipulative man leave the state and escape any sort of investigation into his abuse.  my conscience is seething- i'm angry at myself and at him, and i'm so sad for his wife.  i feel bad for distrusting the police officers (especially ones that i know, and that i *know* are good people).  i feel bad for wasting resources that should be going to helping victims cover medical fees, getting them winter clothing, making sure that the children we shelter have appropriate food and diapers and toys.

i'm not in any trouble, and my supervisor said that everything that i did was right in line because i didn't know, but even still i feel so played.  residents are always trying to manipulate the counselors, for cigarettes or extra food or to convince us they're not smoking pot when they're out, and i'm used to having my bullshit filter up full-strength while at work.  but for some reason i let it down completely with this man and didn't question anything that he said to me.  water under the bridge, but fuck it still doesn't feel very good.


 

edit: word

**edit:**  yes, there is proof that the wife was, in fact, the victim.  i don't work closely enough with law enforcement to be privy to their records, but i do trust my supervisor enough that she wouldn't tell me without being totally sure.  if there were any questions about the wife's story, i would have heard.  there had been previous police involvement on her part before, is all i really know about it, but i don't need to know anymore.","-** work on a domestic violence hotline, received a call from a man, put him up in a hotel for 3 days and requested that the agency give him money to get out of the state and with family, turns out that the man is the abuser and was hurt while his wife was defending herself.  now i feel like a colossal asshole."
339,"so this is a double tifu and it happened about 1,5 years ago. i was going my last year in high school and was under alot of stress from the last exams which led to me having some problems with my sleep. i found taking walks in the middle of the night just before going to bed to be very relaxing and helping me with my issues. 

i was often gone from between 15-30 minutes and any time from a couple hours before midnight to 3 am. i did this for maybe 2 months and i never encountered people when walking (lived in a small town). 

one night i felt that the walking wasn't enought and i had to rub one out aswell before going to bed. or even better, lay in bed watching my monitor a couple feet away (2 meters). sometimes i hear a family member go to the toilet in the middle of the night and just wait for them to be done before i continue. 

so this one night i heard someone walking up the stairs but i thought nothing of it and continued. i heard someone stop just outside my door. shit, what the fuck to do...either i walk up and close the porn on the computer and stand there butt-naked or i stay under my blanket with the porn on. i had no time to react...the door opened. my mom stod there watching me looking back at her. then she looked at my computer and just said ""lncsmb...."". she walked outside again, closed the door and said ""we need to talk"". 

my parents aren't conservative or anything so i didn't really know why she would want to talk about this but it was really embarassing. i followed her down into the living room and was acrually laughing a lot because the situation was so stupid. 

i sat down and then she said ""lncsmb, i've been so worried these past weeks, what have you been up to? have you been selling...*drugs*? i was so shocked i didn't know what to say. i just laughed and clearly explained the situation about my bad sleep (which she was aware of) and that was it, we never spoke of it again. the walks didn't feel the same after that so i stopped shortly after.",mom thinks i'm selling drugs every night when i'm just out for a walk. wants to talk and walks in on me wanking.
340,"so i was smoking a cigarette in my truck driving down the road and i didn't want to throw my cigarette out the window so i put it in a cup of tea from royal farms. cut to later in the night i'm leaving my lady's house around 1 in the morning, i'm tired, sleepy and thirsty so without thinking i grab the cup of tea and down the whole thing...i didn't even notice... i finish the tea and turn the light on to find my car charger for my phone when i see it... a fucking cigarette sitting in the bottom of the cup. i immediately proceed to pull over to the side of the road and puke everywhere. i've been on the verge of puking all day thinking about it.

343,"i was riding my bicycle with a big pack of people on a beach side board walk. adrenaline is pumping testosterone is controlling me. i am in front of the pack, i am leading them down the board walk. i am pedaling ahead and my right arm reaches out. my eyes and mind are on the road. this is strange. a shadowy group is getting closer. i am slowing down and am now in the middle of the pack. the group of people are right next to me. i had just spanked a girl on the ass. i heard laughter and a yell for me to stop. the girl was laughing and the cop was yelling. there was a cop on a mountain bike who saw the whole ordeal. as soon as i stopped my freedom was taken away with my back pack being thrown off and my hands held behind my back. i admitted to the spanking and thought of it as shenanigans, but life is not a porky's movie. in reality what i did was sexual battery and could go to jail for a few months. i am not a hardened criminal.  i am 20, i go to community college, i have never had a girlfriend, i am not a player. moving forward with the story; i was in the back of the paddy-wagon when i knew i fucked up. i spent the next hour watching the stainless steel bench fill up with drunks from the bar and watched them get out to wait in a drunk tank till the morning. then it was down to me and a plastered homeless man wearing an sd county jail sweater, he was face down on the floor yelling at the officer to turn the radio on, it is funny how he already had a uniform. i just sat straight and starred at the wall. the van stopped, the officer had to get the man out by pulling on his feet. i walked out into in under ground parking lot and was directed into a room lit by bleach white fluorescent bulbs. while the homeless guy was screaming with protest about how a 50 year old man should not be treated this way i was siting straight staring at the wall. i was asked to stand and walkover to the photographer, then walkover to the officer taking fingerprints, then walkover to the counter to sign off on my possessions; leather belt... check, california state id... check. i am so thankful my friend took my stuff before i left.
 
jail cell no.01 
""walk through the metal detector and dont touch the sides"" said the officer. i was welcomed by drunks, druggies, and derelicts. some people tried to ""keep the moral up"" by laughing and joking about how we are all in the same kind of shitty situation. i just sat straight and stared at the wall. the room reeked of weeks of defecation body odor. 

jail cell no.2 
it was a copy of the first room with one difference, there was a extra steel sliding door. an officer walked from the extra door ""whoever is trying to make bail needs to come with me"" i gave my name and he told me ""your bail is not listed, just stand over there"".

jail cell no.3
we followed the yellow line on  the linoleum floor that lead us to the next holding cell across from the booking counter. after sitting in the cell my name was called. i was told that my bail was set at 10000 and a bonds man can get me out at 10% . i just go to school, my mom struggles for money, and although my dad can pay for it i doubt he would. 

jail cell no.4
this holding cell had phones and a list of bail bond phone numbers. i spent 2 hours dialing the numbers incorrectly. the jails phone pin number system was never explained to me. after finding out how the phone works i was able to call to start  bail. at fist my mom refused to pay but she passed down my fathers phone number to the bonds man. i own that man twice now, for giving me life and for bailing me out.

the whole time i was there, it was in fear of putting on a blue jump suite. i was feed mystery meat sandwiches and had to drink water from a water fountain on top of a toilet. if i never got bailed, i would have been sent to general population for 3 days till my court day. i latter found out i am getting charged with a missdemeanor and that the victim is not pressing charges. i am never going to do anything like this again. i feel like a horrible person. i learned that what looks like innocent  hooliganism is actually serious. it is not ok to do. the jail was over crowded and under staffed. there needs to be an audit of some sort.

345,"1)so yeah yesterday night, i fucked up. so as i was heading for a super duper night for my friend's birthday, i get to where we meet up to go to the restaurant together. i was pretty high at that point. when i'm under the influence, i fuck up a lot. i say things i don't think i would say sober or i would not say them the way i do. so there was this girl, a friend of a girl. she wasn't officially invited to the restaurant. so i say ''hey, did (friend's whose birthday it is) invited you? or you're coming along with us uninvited? she took offence since she wasn't officially invited and i felt really bad cause she felt bad the whole night for coming ''officially uninvited'' by the birthday guy

2)so after the restaurant, i wasn't high anymore but i was drunk. so as i was waiting for everyone outside of the restaurant, i see this girl i know who works at the gym i go to. she is with her friends. i go to their group and say ''hi (girl i know)''. she comes to me and we start talking but since i was drunk, i didn't have anything to say. so we talk and when i didn't have anymore things to say, i recognize a girl that is in one of my class. 

i say ''hey, i know you, you're in one of my class''. 

she says ''oh i've never seen you''. 

i say ''yeah, i've noticed you. i actually notice every cute girl in my classes since i've got nothing else to do. when i come in to a class, i look for the pretty girls and i decide which one i'm gonna sit next too''

at this point, she isn't really laughing and i think i came out as some sort of creep. one of the friends of the girl in the group says ''so would you sit next to her?'' and i don't know why, i said ''naw, i wouldn't sit next to her'' (i felt really bad for saying that she's ugly when she is actually pretty hot). i say ''hey, i'm just joking, i would'' 

another of her friend says jokingly ''she doesn't seem interested ahah'' i said ''she's not interested yet'' and i left it at that since i've felt there was enough damage done from my part.

so i carpool with a nice lady that i work with. we will occasionally have some fun on the way to and from work. sometimes it's pulling over to the side of the highway for a quickie, sometimes it's good old fashioned road head. today was one of those days.

so she does her thing, expertly might i add, i pop my yop and we continue on to work. great start to the day!

after a little while i get up to get a coffee. as i'm walking to the coffee machine, i happen to look down. right in the middle of my shirt, which has fairly large white stripes on it, is a strange looking beige smudge. weird, it's just about the same colour as her cover-up.

it seems that while we were enjoying ourselves, she had the side of her face pressed up against my stomach and her makeup had rubbed off onto my shirt.

i quickly grab my coffee. on the way back to my desk i pass her in the hall way. i point to my stomach and i can see the initial confusion and then the eventual realisation of what i'm pointing out, cross her face. she turns bright red and mouths 'fuck, i'm sorry!' i then spend the rest of the morning rubbing my stomach, like a pregnant lady rubs her baby, trying to get this large mark off my shirt.",dm;gh

i think we can all see where this is going.

he wakes up, i pour the coffee into his thermos and there's just over a mugs worth in there.  i give him the mug and he sits down to drink it.  i go work on some dishes.  my ocd starts driving me up the wall knowing i've cleaned all the dishes in the kitchen, but that i can't rinse the coffee pot yet cause there's a sip or two of coffee left in there.  assuming he has by now drank enough to be ""topped off,"" i bring the coffee pot to him and proceed to pour the coffee into his cup.  

only it wasn't his cup, it was directly onto his testicles, only shielded by boxers.  which don't make a good barrier from hot liquids.  :/.   fiancé jumped up, checked them out and those suckers were scalded and red. :(. i officially suck.

i should mention now that my backpack is about ten years old and the zippers are getting a little faulty. so about an hour ago i'm walking into math class, and i guess the weight of that textbook was too much on my bag because as i'm walking in front of the class to take my seat, my backpack's zipper finally snaps and out flies everything, and i mean **everything**. within three seconds i turn around to see a trail of my perverted inventory. here's what i, and the rest of my class including my professor sees strewn about the floor: 

a ballgag, a spider gag (keeps the mouth open), handcuffs, blindfolds, leather lingerie and chaps, two buttplugs, a collar and a leash, a corset, and a small red dildo.

what made it even worse was that is wasnt all condensed in one area, it was a line about 4 feet long of our toys. i had to pick them up piece by piece and scramble to my desk. when i got to my desk, the girl who sits next to me says ""you forgot something,"" and i have to stand back up to go pick up the spider gag.

i have to see these people every day for the rest of the semester and probably in subsequent classes, considering my major is math and we're in higher-level courses.

 

**edit**: thanks for taking my situation and turning it from me feeling like a loser into somewhat of a winner. you guys made my day/night/everything.",i just gave my entire math class and probably future classmates a display of my kinky sex toys**
353,"i was using my galaxy tablet reddit app as a newspaper while i was dropping the kids off at the pool, for those who might not get the last half of the last line, i was taking a dump. i got so tuned into reading all sorts of stuff from the front page that a good long period of time passes by, realising that i had been sitting on the toilet naked for ages, decided to put my galaxy down so i can stand up to wipe, get halfway up and then feel myself falling forward, before i know it i've just rammed my head into the bathroom door. i wake up laying on the tile floor, still naked, with my mother heavily knocking on the door and shouting if i am ok and what is going on. i get up and tell her i fell into the door and she laughs then tells me to shower coz the bathroom stinks.

354,"this happened to me last summer, but i thought i might as well share this chain reaction fuck up. so they day started off as normal and i decided to take a run at the local trail. after my run i decided to drink my gatorade and sit on the bench right next to the parking lot. i get back in my car and as i'm driving home, i realize i left my shirt and phone on the roof of my car. i drive back to the parking lot and in the entrance is my shirt and obliterated phone. fuck up #1. naturally being a dumb teenager, i went out and impulse bought a new cell phone. i got home and my parents informed me that i had insurance on my old phone and that i just wasted $300. so me and my dad went back to the phone store to put the money back on my card....... and i lost my wallet. fuck up #2. so my went back home to grab my wallet. he searched in my car for it and conveniently found my bubbler, 2 bowls, and a little over an 1/8 of weed, which he then disposed of. fuck up #3. after getting torn a new one from my dad i was then phone less, car-less, weed-less, and wallet-less.","ran over my phone, lost my wallet, dad found my weed stash and pieces and disposed of them all in a massive chain reaction."
355,"backstory:

so, as a teenager, i have to text my mother letting her know i arrived at school safely. i had just gotten an iphone 4 the other week and it was raining, like drizzling.

what happened:
as i'm walking under a scaffold, i decide to take my phone out and text her. one (and i mean one) drop of rain drips onto it and i didn't give a fuck because i didn't think the drop would do anything.
(a week later, actually a few hours before i typed this)
so i'm at the apple store's ""genius bar"" (a bit pretentious, apple?) and they tell me that water damage isn't covered. so they said they cannot fix the water damage (which is a lie, but doing so yourself will void the warranty) so i was given another iphone which i had to pay for. scumbag apple...",water on iphone. scumbag apple took my money.

so i was playing around with this thing called sendgrid. it allows you to send e-mails through a relay server. the important thing to note here is with these kind of servers, you can send an e-mail using any address in the ""from"" field. in short, it allows e-mail spoofing.

i had been watching tpb and wikileaks documentaries. i got carried away yesterday and sent a mass mail to my whole batch at midnight declaring that all the lectures of the next day have been cancelled. i used the registrar's e-mail address as the sender. that must be one of the stupidest mistakes of my life. the actual registrar then sent a mail saying that his account had been ""hacked"" and no classes have been cancelled.


our university has the bloody cyberoam. cyberoam keeps a track of what kind of activity each user is doing. i got caught and had to meet the registrar today. with the all the logs in front of me, i can't even deny my actions. i had to give in a written apology.


i'll probably be called before the disciplinary action committee. it's a bunch of soul-less professors. i think i might get removed from the university hostel for a semester. that's bad because living anywhere else is very costly.

edit: i do understand that i have been an idiot, and very childish, wasn't really trying to hurt anybody..it was just a very thoughtless attempt at temporary amusement",sent mass mail using registrar's email address declaring all of tomorrow's classes cancelled. got caught.**
357,"it was a long night as my 7 month old was having a rough night. in the morning, i grabbed two things to bring into bathroom to get ready... my eye drops for my contacts and some campho-phenique for my horrible chapped lips.

dropped some eye drops unto my lips and figured it was just super liquidy because maybe my lips were not as dry anymore. got to the eye part, put some campho-phenique on my finger, and was about to put it on my eye when my 7 month old starts crying. i realize my error with the campho-phenique and was glad my son snapped me out before this happened.

ran to get him, wiped my eye and realized i forgot to clean it off my finger. after several rinses and 3 hours later, my eye doesn't burn anymore. it just feels a bit numb.",i forgot to wash my hands and wiped something into my eye that really shouldn't have been there.
358,"so, i ride a comutter train to work and therefore purchase a monthly ticket.  i arrived at the ticket kiosk at the last minute, the train was pulling into the statiin.  i could have prevented this all together had i not left my wallet at home last fiday and purchased my ticket then.  so here i am on monday. i pulled into the parking lot and sat in my truck, listening to the radio, and enjoying the warm air.  it is near 30 everyday degrees outside.  

there is an app i use to track the location of the train in real time.  so, when the train starts to get close, i began making my way to the train platform.  the train horn blows.....then it hits me.  crap!!! i didnt get my march ticket! i rush over to one of two kiosks and quickly punch in my order on the touch screen. inserting my bank card, a message is displayed saying the transaction could not be completed.  i pull out another card, noticing someone standing behind me.  the train now pulling into the station.  the adrenaline starts pumping.  i put in the other card....wait....waiting....  no!!!! another message appears saying the transaction cannot be completed. i pull out my card....the lady standing behind me waives her hands as if to say ""move out of my way"".  she is clearly in a hurry.  people are now boarding the train.  i walk a few feet away.   i will have to catch the next train.  dang it!   today is all read starting to suck!  

using my bank's app, i checked my account balances.  as i figured, i had insufficient funds in both accounts.  so, i transferred funds.  i thought to myself how wonderful technology was.  i was dissapointed in myself for not remembering to get the ticket once i arrived at the station, some 15 minutes before the train pulled in.


i walk bqck over to the kiosk, ready to purchase my monthly ticket.  as i begin to punch in my destination info, i look down.  what is this inthe ground?   its a ticket.  i guve it a look over, its worth $188.20.  its to my destination.  my heart fell nnto my stomach.   i assume the lady was in such a hurry, she dropped her ticket after purchasing it.  she boarded the train...with no ticket.  conductors ask for tickets.  if you dont have a ticket, you get a $150 citation and have to go to court to resolve the ticket.  i have the lady's ticket and dont know who she is or what she looks like.

i got a free monthly ticket but feel like crap.",i waited to the last minute to get a train ticket and contributed to the haste that caused the lady behind me to drop her ticket.  she is out $188.20 for the ticket and will get $150 citation from the train conductor. i got a free ticket for march.
359,"this started last night at work: a wine and liquor store in a fairly nice part of my town. around 5pm an average looking guy came in and explained that he had accidentally locked his keys in his car while picking it up from the auto repair shop next door. he asked if we had a coat hanger or something that he could use to pry the door open. i told him that we didn't have any coat hangers and that i couldn't think of anything that he might be able to use. then he wondered if we had a doorstop and i said that, yes, we did. i let him borrow it, telling him that we really needed it back, please, and he replied that, yes he would bring it right back. fast forward to 8:45, just fifteen minutes before closing, and the guy has yet to return, with or without our doorstop. boss showed up to close the store and i had to explain that i gave his hunk of wood to a dude who never brought it back. i figured he had either forgotten or accidentally broke it and was too ashamed to admit it. boss, however, was absolutely positive that he had seen our rare and wondrous door stopping device and simply had to have it. ""he's a fuckin' thief!"" he said over and over, ""do you know how hard it is to find those? he just wanted my doorstop!"" i apologized profusely and told him i would get him another as soon as possible. i planned on going to lowe's and having them cut me one from some scrap. hard to find my ass. i ended up having some scrap wood at home and asked my dad to cut one for me since i can't work his saw, and took the new doorstop over to the store around 3 this afternoon. we're closed on sundays but most of the time boss is there doing paperwork. he wasn't, though, when i got there so i set the doorstop on the mat next to the door. boss isn't terribly observant though so i went back and moved it to the window ledge so he wouldn't trip on it. upon leaving, however, i found two police cars blocking my way. something had set the alarm off, even though i didn't even touch the door! they thought i was a burglar. i told them i worked there and was just dropping something off. they told me to stick around until boss got there to verify my story. when he finally got there 45 minutes later i was freezing my tits off in the 35 degree wind and got bitched at again for setting off the alarm even though i have no idea how i managed it. 

so much for trying to help people out. 

the cops were pretty stand up guys though, and were glad to chat with me while we waited.

 

update! boss called me today to tell me that the guy who stole the doorstop was a man who recently got fired from the restaurant around the corner, and indeed had his car worked on recently and probably did lock his keys in it, but i'm guessing that he wasn't able to get the door wedged open and just didn't bother to bring it back since he's apparently a nut job. boss also said that the guy was a heroin addict (probably why he got fired) and that he's really messed up. the bartender at the restaurant texted him demanding the doorstop back so we'll see. anyway, boss seemed to be in a fine mood so i guess i'm off the hook.","let a guy borrow a doorstop, got the cops called on me."
360,"this actually happened friday, but i haven't been on reddit in a while. anyway, i decided to wear my favorite pair of light blue jeans. i noticed there was a small tear starting along the right leg, but i figured they were pretty durable jeans and they would hold up. well, i was horribly mistaken. i'm in school and third period rolls around when i notice a massive crotch hole in my pants. the thing stretched from my balls to my ass. i spent the rest of the day waddling around with my legs closed and pushing my chair way too far into my desk as to remain unexposed. to everyone that wasn't aware of my dilemma, it looked like i was trying to conceal an erection throughout the entire day. i tried to cover it up with blue duct tape that i found on a teachers desk, but it just stood out more.","put too much trust in a pair of jeans, went to school with a giant crotch hole, ruined my friday"
361,"let me start by saying, my sense of humor can be summed up in one click: /r/imgoingtohellforthis

in health class we recently got a new workbook. a softcover book, that we keep. in a fit of boredom, i flipped through the book and, on every image of a person, drew something very offensive. swastikas, penises, racism, sexism, religion-ism, you name it. on the back of the book, there was a picture i drew of jesus, on a cross, crying for help. i had not realized i left the book in class. my teacher saw it, then brought it to the office.

about a week later, i get called down to the office. i sat in front of the office for about 20 minutes, trying to remember what i did to get called down there. when the principle finally called me in, i had decided i did not do anything wrong. i walked in the office, and the first thing i saw was my health book, lying on the desk. shit. the principal, the guidance counselor, and my teacher were all there. i was asked about sexual abuse in my childhood (of which i have none).  when you get down to it, they were making this out to be a cry for help, and using the picture of jesus on the back to convince me that i need therapy.

when the day eventually ended, i went home, and had to confront my mother (who knows about my sense of humor). i walked in the front door, and was greeted with, ""you're a fucking dumbass"". then we laughed about the whole book ordeal. 

on monday, my mother is coming in to convince my counselor i do not need any therapy. after this happens i will come back here, and make an update post.","i drew a swastika on my workbook, and everyone is up in arms."
362,"i literally just started working at a frozen yogurt shop. apparently, there was a mandatory staff meeting yesterday, and an email was sent out about it earlier in the week. however, my only access to the internet is through my phone, because i can no longer afford prices from major telecom providers.

the first email explained there was a meeting, what time to be there, and that it was mandatory.

the second email was sent yesterday, 5 minutes into the meeting, letting me know i missed the meeting, and letting me know that i need to let them know in the future if i can't make it.

the third email was sent today, at 9 am est, letting me know i was being let off because i don't respect the business, and can't even be bothered to respond to an email.

now, my phone is incredibly important to me, for reasons just like this one. my boss loves sending emails, rather than saying something in person. so, i spent the last week trying to sell off my useless possessions to be able to afford my cell bill, and finally, around 4 pm est today, i was able to make the payment. service was immediately resumed, and i checked my email. guess what was waiting for me? an email letting me know i'm fired.

now, i feel that this is unacceptable. i let my boss know what the problem was, and why i couldn't respond to his emails, but he's told me he must stick with his decision.

not only is that not right, but i have worked my ass off for this man, after waiting months for the store to open so i could actually start work. i work the night shift, from 5 pm - 12 am or so, and make sure all the machines are clean for whoever comes in the morning. i clean the dishes and begin prep for tomorrow, all to make sure his job is easier when he gets there in the morning.

all in all, maybe i shouldn't be so upset about losing a job where i was obviously unappreciated, but i also might lose my girlfriend over this. she was never fond of the fact that i don't go to school, and losing my job has her second guessing everything.

so, i guess i should subscribe to /r/unemployed, and begin the tedious task of job searching for the next few months.","i couldn't afford my phone bill and got fired because i couldn't respond to an email. after trying to explain the situation to my boss, whom i work my ass off for, he decided to stick with his decision. all because i couldn't pay my phone bill."
363,"this is a second half a tifu (i'll spare everyone the other).  i wanted a wet/dry shop vac for my garage, and bought a bargain one at a liquidator/take-back outlet store.  i got it for about half what i would have paid brand new, but part of the deal was that it was as-is and no return.  we opened the box and it looked good, plugged it in and it sounded good, so fine, i'll take it.

got it home and realized it had no hose and no attachments, just the extension nozzles.  i was so focused on the vac condition that i hadn't noticed the lack of other stuff.

ended up buying a hose and an adapter, which cost more than i paid for the vacuum.  got home--everything worked.  then i realized i should probably check the filter.  opened it up and--there was the original hose, coiled up inside the tank.  

oh, and the filter's filthy.  i could have spent the money on a filter instead.",it would have been cheaper to have purchased one brand new
364,"okay, new boyfriend, everything is wonderful, i'm at his parent's house with him in the games room and things are getting steamy. the games room is at the back of the house and his parents are in the front room watching tv.  
being the young risk takers we are, we start going at it doggy-style on the floor. having requested for him not to fap for a few days to make his orgasm really powerful, he gets into it pretty intensely and in the heat of the moment gives me my first creampie.  
he cums buckets in me, pulls out and puts everything away just in case we get walked in on. i lean back, pull my pants up, sit down and begin to do the largest, longest queef i have ever heard. it sounds like a diarrhoea fart of the worst kind and last about 30 seconds. there's no way his parents can't hear it. the fluid is sputtering out of my cavity like a waterfall accompanied by all the air that'd been pounded in there from the shenanigans. he's laughing, i'm laughing, which is only making me queef more, and all the while his load is spilling out of me through my underwear *and* trousers. i get up from the event, still sputtering, and he points out a huge wet stripe down the back of my trousers.

needless to say the walk of shame up the stairs to the bathroom was not an easy one.","got creampied by my oh, soggy queef of the year follows, parents only a few metres away."
365,"preface; this happened some time before i heard of /r/tifu (ie not today)



the time of year had once again rolled around for my army cadets unit to go hiking. therefore, off we went for the weekend to the nearest government-owned land, an army base three hours away. i don't really know how big the dang thing is, but the majority of the ""base"" is one big wilderness that they use for practicing with artillery and other training. we never get anywhere near anything bigger than a firewatch shack on these things.


anyways, on day 2, we'd already walked for a morning. sunny day, hilly terrain, gigantic sandy strips for the purpose of breaking potential fires. (because artillery shells can light them, it seems) it was around 11, we'd just reached a clearing, and the hill in the middle of it looked very appealing.


""alright, take a break""


aww yeah, here we go. for the first time in my life, instead of sitting, i've found ground at the perfect slope to fall into a sitting position without injuring myself on the large, heavy rucksack on my back. seriously, for a kid mid to early teens, the metal framework on those weighs a ton.


down i go, down, down, down, ahh. nothing has ever felt so goo...


owowowowow!!!


unable to immediately stand (as movement of the leg caused increased pain) i rolled halfway over to see the problem. what greeted me took a short while to comprehend. i saw about a dozen small plants, slightly larger than a toonie each, with inch-long spikes extending at all angles. my (wimpy) shouts of (mostly surprise and) agony soon drew the attention of my squadmates. they were polite enough not to laugh, but the nearest officer had a chuckle as he lent me his multitool to rip the bloody things out.


all told, i removed a rather impressive arsenal from my leg and left buttock. oddly enough, the large spike sunk a full centimeter into my leg bled not at all, while the tiny spike barely breaking the surface released at least a teaspoon and a half of blood to run down my shin.
two years later, i also managed to remove the last spike from between the layers of my track pants.


sadly, those horrific torture-plants became increasingly common as our trip progressed. including when we got back to our initial camp, which hadn't seemed to be infested the first time we were there.",op was the first casualty in the dawn of the cacti.
366,"this is a more cringeworthy tifu post.today i went clothes shopping. and in my area, many of the clothing stores are staffed by attractive women. so being the male that i am, i didn't mind asking for help and flirting with one particular cashier who had a better eye for fashion. when i finally pick out a few shirts, she takes me to the counter and rings me up. she then says,"" i'm glad you found something you like!"". now i like to think of myself as a brave guy, trying out jokes on random folks i meet. also, i'm a younger guy, so i figured that this particular statement would work.i was wrong. ""yeah, well my mom normally does all my shopping, so this is a first for me!""immediately after i said that, her smile lost a few molars, and a nearby coworker did everything to keep from laughing. her forced response "" well it's good that you're getting out there!"".and i left, never to return.",told hot 27 year old cashier that my mommy does my clothes shopping.
367,"okay, so a little background info: my sister is 14 and is a huge drama queen. she over exaggerates everything and always have. so, today was no different in my book. 

she came into my room about 1:00 this morning to talk. we (mostly i) spoke about our feelings towards my parents (divorced, he lives in nyc and she lives in tx, we live with her, he has decided to sue for custody) and emotional issues (she's constantly angry and i'm depressed). we talked for about two hours and then i started rambling and she wasn't responding, so i assumed she was listening and carried on talking. 

a few minutes later, i realized that she had a funny look on her face. i asked if she was okay and she couldn't respond. about half a minute later when she did, she told me she felt trapped in her body and like she couldn't move. being the drama mama that she is, i decided she was joking, as she often does things like this. 

twenty minutes later she still couldn't move. she rolled off of my bed on to the floor and laid there for a good fifteen minutes. i was making jokes at her, calling her an inchworm and such. 

""what's the hardest part about eating a vegetable?"" 
""chewing?"" 
""the wheelchair."" 

around ten minutes later, she starts twitching. then she starts uncontrollably shaking (not seizing, i'm epileptic and would have noticed that instantly). at first i didn't know what to do, so i dragged her by her arms out of my room and ran and got my mom. 

we deliberated for about fifteen minutes before calling 911. her shaking gradually got worse and she said she was so cold. the ambulance came and took us to the hospital. 

they took her through triage and whatnot, and when the doctor came in, she asked to perform a rectal exam. (this gave me a seizure, a gelastic one, for anyone who cares.) so my mother and i stepped outside to let the doctor work. 

apparently my sister had a very bad anxiety/panic attack stemming from a lack of sleep and stress. we just got back from the hospital.

368,"so this happened last night.

me and my bf got some alcohol last night, he got cider and i got wine. i thought it would be fun to get tipsy and have sex, cause its generally pretty fun. well no that didn't happen.
so we were in bed and i've had 5 glasses of wine, feeling the perfect tipsy, i got into my lingerie and m bf was finding us something to watch to set the mood, just for a little fun.
and it had been maybe half an hour and i felt something happening, i sat up, and puked into my hand and all over the carpet.
so my bf slowly leads me to the bathroom to clean myself up and incase i need to again, while he's cleaning everything up while dry-gagging on the stench.

so i got into my flannel pjs cause that was the end.

and thenn, it happened again, this time i had a bowl, my hair was in the bowl covered and it was just bad.

but he was there next to me before i knew it and have me a hair tie to put my hair back.","tried to have tipsy sex with my bf, wine had a bad reaction and vomited all over the floor, and learned my bf is actually fucking amazing."
369,"alright. from the title you may think that this is just another fuck up about jerking off after touching peppers. but no. this is worse. also, this fuck up happened last night, but i had to suffer the consequences today.

i recently went to the dermatologist about these bumps on my skin which i thought were eczema. i was pissed about possibly having an auto-immune disease, but after taking a look at my arm, i was told i have a fairly common condition known as keratosis pilaris. if you're unfamiliar with it, it basically means that my skin is so dry, that hair follicles cannot break through my skin and so they pile up underneath and cause bumps. the dermatologist gave me several samples of a cream that would get rid of them. all that the cream does is make my skin peel so my skin will be soft enough for the hair to break through. you can see where this is going..

so, later that night, i put the cream over these bumps on my arms, chest, shoulders, stomach, face, and stray bumps in random areas. right after i was done, i didn't think about washing my hands. but i did get a random boner and decide to jerk off. i put lotion on my hand, turned on the porn, fapped away, and fell asleep.

i woke up in the morning, and went to the bathroom to shower and brush my teeth. i took off my shirt, saw that my shoulders, chest, stomach, and face started peeling, and it itched like crazy. it was annoying because i also couldn't hide the fact that my face was flaking. i took my pants off for the shower, and lo and behold, my dick was peeling. shaft, head, and somehow, my balls. the balls itched way more than anything else. i couldn't stop scratching. and since i was scratching bare balls so much, they started bleeding.

so there i am, in the bathroom, scratching my bloody balls and trying to flake all the dead skin off of my penis. i just decided to take a shower and try to ignore it, but it was no use. i was scratching my balls all day, and it was horrible.","i accidentally jerked off after applying a skin cream that makes me peel, my dick and balls started peeling, scratched my balls to the point of bleeding."
370,"i work as part of it for the department of child support services, and this group is are a lively bunch of individuals. 

taking some inspiration [from this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/16hqf0/one_pair_of_googly_eyes_one_trip_to_target/) i asked one of my coworkers to purchase me a package of googly eyes to decorate these motivational posters for child support.

i started in our little area to see how these turned out, [hilarious](http://i.imgur.com/ooqk6eph.jpg) and so [every](http://i.imgur.com/m7ydvos.jpg) [time](http://i.imgur.com/qgjczpph.jpg) i went out to answer a ticket, i would place another pair of eyes on another poster until i had an [album](http://imgur.com/a/sefja) of joy to throw around, thinking ""what harm could be done with some googly eyes?"" as they came off easily during my initial test run.

about two weeks ago i got a call from two of our higher up managers calling me and my coworkers for a meeting, we are in a transition period so we all thought it was a nice little meeting of what is to come and the changes ahead for the section. turns out there is a investigation going on for vandalism and destruction of dcss property and all four of us were involved via video evidence.

thinking to myself ""well my friends didn't do anything, i'll tell them that i was the one that did googly eyes as a lighthearted measure of fun""

the investigation comes around and i tell them exactly that, they report to me that i will find out what will happen in a week.  seeing that this is a bigger issue than i initially thought, i went to go apologize to the graphics artists and tell them that i was the one placing the googly eyes onto the posters, to my surprise, they were really cool about it and laughed about it.

a week later, my coworkers get a letter of reprimand stating that they observed me placing googly eyes on a poster and did not report the vandalism. my turn comes around and i'm called into my managers office with our hr person and i'm handed a packet containing [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/vhxvh) and supporting documents. 

as a result of the googly eyes, $846.85 dollars of damages was caused broken down into:

* three 6' x 2' posters @ $35.40 each
* one 3' x '2 poster @ $20.65
* repair, patch and paint one wall @ $480.00 ([the damage](http://i.imgur.com/zmmql9e.png))

371,"so, today after dinner at around 8pm myself and my household decided to take a stroll. it started like any other stroll, except tonight we turned right at a particular field rather than going straight ahead. because our dog is a lurcher she loves to run around, so we let her off the leash when we reach an open field full of stubble. so, as we walked up the other pathway, we see a couple with their dog, politely say hi and continue walking. a few moments later, our dog, nala, goes out of sight, seconds pass and i hear her barking, so i ran to find her and see that she is chasing sheep. to get to the sheep all i had to do was walk over a small gap in the hedges. i started shouting her name, and of course, no response, so i ran up to her and pick her up after she has been chasing the sheep for about 15 seconds at the most. i hear the farmer's dogs barking... you can see where this is going. but it gets better, these sheep that my dog was chasing, were not only pregnant, but were pedigree, and their lambs worth lotsa money. i gave the farmer our details as he needs to contact the police for the 'dog attack', and soon we will be visited by them etc etc. in about 10 days we will be notified if there have been any miscarriages, and if there are then we will be fined. and we have no home insurance to cover it, and i am a fucking student... but the annoying thing is that the path was right next to a public footpath, and there were no signs saying 'private land, do not tresspass' etc, or at least it was too dark to see them, and on top of that, there was no fucking fence or anything protecting the sheep in the first place!!! -__________________-","walked my dog a new way, chases pregnant pedigree sheep, and we may be fined if there are any misscarriages."
372,"so. i work in an hour and a half, and am terribly lazy.

every day, rather than ironing my work uniform, i just toss it into the dryer for a while before getting dressed. today was a day like any other, except that by chance i woke up unusually early. no problem- hop out of bed, usual routine, toss my clothes in the dryer, set timer for longer so they'll be ready in time to get dressed for work, go about my business. right?

so, instead of twenty minutes, they're in the dryer for an hour and a half. i pull the clothes out a few minutes ago, rub them on my face for the glorious warmth, like you do, and proceed to get dressed...

it's important to note that i generally go commando, so there was nothing to protect my bits 'n berries from the searing awfulness that happened next.

ever get into a car that's been in the sun for a while on a hot day, and touch the seatbelt clasp by mistake? imagine that, only instead of a clasp it's a red hot zipper, and instead of your arm or hand or whatever, it's the skin at the base of your shaft where it connects to the sack (if you don't own a penis, imagine it's your nipple; same kind of sensitive). basically that, but moreso. there was an audible sizzle and the smell of burnt flesh, and my vision went white for a moment as searing pain overtook every fiber of my being. that shit *hurt*. 

there's a blister there now about the size of a pencil eraser. i have to go to work, and remain standing in front of customers for the duration of a four hour shift, with a blister the size of an eraser rubbing back and forth between my shaft and balls. this is actively the worst thing, reddit. the worst.","burned my shaft on a hot zipper, now i have to stand around with a blister and can't adjust all day."
373,"i was texting a girl i like but we are just friends ( i asked her out before  but got let down gently) and the conversation went like this:

me: how is your family
her: i hate my family!!!!

i tried to back out but she carried on

her: they r disgusting ppl who want me to die!! which will be soon!!!
me:calm down you over exaggerating.

she tells me about this mental disorder which is fake, i looked it up. she says the exploit this illness and it makes her cut herself. i then joked 'thats why (boy you like) dumped you' and she went ballistic. 3 hours later and i'm going be murdered because i'm insensitive.","joked to self harmer about boy dumping her, she doesn't appreciate my humour."
374,"today i fucked up by trusting a fart which was not actually a fart.  

fortunately, i was using the urinal at the time, so i was able to quickly switch to the stall, but not before causing irreparable damage to my underwear and pants.

the worst part is, i had to go home, shower, and change, making me late for my son's first holiday concert!  it was either that, or show up smelling like shit :(",shit my pants; almost missed my son's concert recital.
375,"it's the weekend. most people would be off work/school and chilling. me? i went to school today because i was doing some music coursework. i then went shopping afterwards. i left the house at 9:00 (i shouldn't even be awake at that time on a saturday, let alone out of bed). i got back at about 18:00. i'm absolutely shitted, and decided to treat myself to having a bath, which is a luxury as baths make my hair go weird and so i can't have them during the week as i have to style my hair and all that stupid shit. 

the bath was shit. the bath water was all from the hot tap, yet there was no hot water in the bathtub. 

i leave the bathroom and begin to listen to some music in my nakedness while drying myself. my mum always gets pissed at me whenever i don't wash out the bath as soon as i get out of the bath, so i go to do that, as well as put my jewellery back on and get my clothes from off the floor. my mum was in her room and doing something for her boss. my brother had his friend over, but they were downstairs watching some stupid videos. i figured that if one of them were to come up then i would either hear it, or the laughter will stop.

*you'd have thought*

i was rinsing the bath out, and thought i heard my mum call out. i open the door and see my brother's friend standing there. he looks at me, i look at him. i hide behind the door. he continues to look at me with a [shocked/terrified face](http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a624/brainiacnovellover/bth_obama-shocked-face_zps45cdf799.png). turns out my mum was calling me, to tell me that she was going out and will return back in about 2 minutes. 

this kid is in year 7 (first year) and i'm in year 11 (last year). he's also in my form..

376,"yesterday was a succession of fuckups, every individual one being worse than the one before. i've never had a truly ridiculous day, so please bear with me in this journey.

the array of fuckups began a week and two days ago, when my shitgargling asshole of a suitemate maintained a steady parade of people in and out of his room from 8pm to 4am, showing off and sharing his ounce of weed. i smoke myself, but he is the kind of smoker who snapchats everyone on his friends list a picture of a bud with a lighter for scale and ""omggggggggggg"" and ""f*ckdddd upppp ;p"" and other comments that make me want to grate blue cheese with his face. this isn't the only reason i hate him; that's another story. the tl;dr of this kid is ""calls mom in to do his cleaning at college and brags about it."" 

anyway, so it's finals week, on a thursday, and he's pulling this fuckery. i'm planning on leaving my school in new york on the 20th to go on vacation, and then returning home to florida on the 28th. however, with the pile of dishes in the sink (shitgargler's), trash stinking up the dorm (shitgargler's duty, but his mom had to work, so), and a neverending stream of like-minded individuals all circlejerking over an ounce of weed, i had enough. i booked a ticket back to florida for friday the 13th. what's the worst that could happen?

**a lot.**

i'm very frugal; i have to be, with my family's economic situation and the loans i took out to go to school in new york city, even though i did get a pretty great aid package. i searched for hours for this ticket, and eventually got one around $130, which is very reasonable. 

i had been talking to my ex/current/kind of/long distance/ girlfriend about how excited i was to come home and see her on the 28th. i was coming home two weeks earlier now, but i thought, why tell her? it'll be a great surprise.

fast forward to thursday night. i had squeezed two weeks of final paper writing into five days, and was hurting. i was exhausted, i was leaving town in 20 hours, and i was just done with new york in general. suddenly, a text. my friend from downstairs wanted to say goodbye before i left.

turns out, four of us said goodbye to half a fifth of jack and half a fifth of cinnamon whiskey. i stumble upstairs at 4am, look at my paper still pulled up on my computer, shrug, and pass out.

i woke up at 9 to go to my volunteer teaching gig in chinatown. it was the last class of the semester, so everyone was bringing in home-cooked food for a bit of a potluck. at this point, i was coming out of the hangover. whiskey normally makes me poop like crazy, but i didn't. this should have been an enormous red flag to avoid eating homemade asian food, but no. the hangover must be fed. i ate everything.

two hours later, i headed to little india to meet a professor and class for an end of the year free meal. once again, haven't pooped. shouldn't eat more food. do anyway.

now, to get to jfk, i have to take a train downtown, transfer, and then take another train right to the airport. i 100% believed that i had to take the r train to the a train. this was a sincere belief of mine. after hauling my bags and banjo through the station, i sit down on the r train, and look for my stop.

i don't see my stop.

i got on the wrong fucking train.

i was supposed to ride the 6 train to the a train, and unless you've ridden the subway in nyc, you can't really realize how fucking dumb i am. allow me to be clear. *i am fucking dumb.*

so there i was, laden with bags, standing on the corner of some random street where i left the train in panic. i was in chinatown, with tons of bags, an hour and a half to escape the city during rushhour, and not a plan in the world.

i told you before that i'm a frugal guy. this is why i was riding the subway to the airport: one ride cost $2.50. that's a sweet deal. however, now i am out of time, and out of options. i need to take a cab.

i hailed one down, and asked the driver how much a ride to jfk would be. he smiled and said, ""$52, sir.""

well i about shit my pants. my entire life in new york is avoiding spending money, so that i could spend it on things i really love, like food, and staying warm. now i had no choice. i had to get to the airport; i was running out of time.

i was pouting in the cab, thinking about all of the things i could buy for $52. on top of that, the driver was farting a little, and kept opening the windows to blast his gas out of the cab with some frigid wind. now, remember that girl i have the complicated thing with? well, thinking i still wasn't going to be home until the 28th, she was having a little fun by herself, and sexting me up like crazy. so here i was, exhausted from my day, mad about money, half-chubbed, with the smell of fart in my nose.

most excellent.

arriving at jfk was easy, security was a proper shit show, boarding was a shit show, but whatever. i made it to my seat, and promptly began to sleep.

i woke with a start.we were rumbling down the runway, and an adorable small child sitting across from me began to whimper. i suppose that her parents had briefed her on the way to the airport: ""okay, darling, your tummy might feel a little weird during the flight, that's called being seasick."" i suppose this, because as soon as the plane began rolling down the runway at speed, the girl began to scream, ""*i'm seasick! i'm seasick! i'm seasick!*""

she didn't stop until we reached cruising altitude, and when she did, i faded into the most blissful and well-deserved sleep.

i wake with a start. the captain is announcing our descent into orlando. i wonder why i woke with such violence. my stomach responds. 

all that whiskey, all that chinese food, and all that indian food, had conspired against me. there was quite the successionist movement occurring in my bowels, and i was quite content to allow it to continue. 

the whimpering child started up her wail once again: ""*i'm seasick! i'm seasick! i'm seasick!*""

we were descending, i thought with a poop-addled brain. that gives me thirty minutes tops. i fought my way back through the aisles during pretty substantial turbulence, each bump bouncing the poop ever more convincingly toward my booty hole.

with the shouts, the bumps, and my exhausted mind, the hallway stretched on forever. i bumped into arms, legs, and heads, in the aisle, careless in my pain.

i get to the bathroom, close the door, toilet paper the seat, and then... nothing. immense pain in my intestines, but no poop.

what.

the. 

fuck.

i push, i massage my belly, i think happy thoughts, and still nothing.

a few minutes later, i hear what i've been dreading. ""ladies and gentlemen, we're on final approach...""

we had 10,000 feet of altitude. i had no where to go. i willed myself to shit.

and so i did.

my goodness, the things that happened in those two minutes are simply indescribably. noises, smells, textures, all amid the bumping and shaking of a descent. 

as suddenly as it began, it stopped. i was in shock for a moment or two, then quickly cleaned up and washed my hands.

later that night, i surprised the lady, and fucked for the first time in five months. it all worked out okay.",emergency evacuation mid-flight; subsequent successful touchdown at local landing strip.**
377,"my professor is an old family friend, so i knew him before this class and had his number from a few years back.  my boyfriend happens to have the same name as him.  he got a new number today, and before i had it saved as ""(his name) <3"", so there was never any ambiguity.  but, as i obviously don't text or call my professor, i had forgotten i even had his number, so i saved my bfs new number as ""(his name)"". 

prior to class, i was with my boyfriend, so i hadn't texted him in hours while i had been texting other people, so our convo thread was close to the bottom of all my texts and lazy me just started a new text instead of going down.  basically, the text went something along the lines of ""i can't wait to get done with this stupid class and get back into bed with you;)"" and without thinking, i sent it immediately to his name.  except, it wasn't him.

my professors phone went off shortly after i sent it, and he said ""sorry - my sister is having a baby, i need to check this"".  alright, cool, but after he read it he got this really ""omfgwtf"" look on his face and stammered that everyone should do some problem in the book.  it was weird, but he recovered.  after class, he asked me to stay a second, and we ended up fucking.  

just kidding, he told me to delete his number immediately as he could potentially get fired and i get in disciplinary trouble if anyone saw this, accident or not.  :(","if you're going to send an 'i cant wait to get back in bed with you' text to your so, make damn sure it isn't a close family friend & sending it could potentially ruin his/her career"

we only had cold water in our dorm since a few days so i called the plumber. the night before we had a heavy booze with some friends. so the plumber came over in the morning and i had the hangover of my life, i swear i wanted to die, i just felt so sick. 
while he was in the bathroom to fix the water heater, it just got worse. 
he was doing his job and i couldn't hold it anymore. i ran into the bathroom and threw up like i never did before. fucking niagara falls. like one minute straight. 
when i finished, i turned around and he gave me the most awkward look ever. i looked at him and said ""uuuhm, sorry"" and left the room. most embarrassing moment of my life. he didn't say a word, fixed the heater and left the dorm.

381,"this happened a couple years ago when i was still in high school and masturbated a lot ^more ^than ^i ^do ^now.

(note, i was reminded of this incident when i read /u/ejaculator123's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1kgsc7/tifu_by_ejaculating_while_my_dad_hugged_me/).)

it was an ordinary day on spring break. both of my parents were at work, so being the horny teen that i was, it was time to turn on a chick-on-chick flick and whip my disco stick. i had a nice reclining computer chair which i sat in to take care of my fruity duties and a big ol' computer monitor to gaze upon the glory that is internet porn. as i was about to finish, i realized the tissue box was a bit out of reach. luckily i was able to snatch a tissue and catch most of my fertilizer, but i noticed a drop on the floor. i looked all over the floor to make sure i got it all. i was so certain that i did.

before bed i remembered my father wanted to borrow a blank cd. my desk has lower shelves under the main area, which is where i kept my blank cds. so, in the dark, i blindly put a blank cd in a ziplock baggy and brought it out to the counter where my dad kept his wallet and keys so he would see it.

the next day i went to grab another cd and noticed there was a weird substance running down the side of them (they were in a stack [like this](http://i.imgur.com/dcqdqni.jpg)). oh shit. since the one i gave my dad was on the top that means ^that ^one ^probably ^had ^the ^most ^semen ^on ^it.

when my dad came home i asked him if he used the cd. he said yes. i asked if there was anything weird about it. he said there was some weird sticky stuff on it. i could tell he wanted to start laughing. he knew. so i just flat out said ""dad there was semen on that disk"". we both laughed about it, but i still cringe every time i think about the fact that my dad probably had physical contact with my haploid cells.",i juiced my goose and some juice flew loose onto a blank disk that i gave to my father.
382,"i'll try to make this short. i met my best friends sister two days ago, she's incredibly cute but it was his sister so i thought i'd talk to him about it first. he says it's fine hook up, whatever, but then i did, twice, while he was home. he told me to stop but i didn't, i called her and we hooked up a third time. later that night, my other good friend's ex from 2 years ago hits me up to hang out. her and i were always good friends and i'm pretty sure my buddy is completely over her so i go over, one thing leads to another and we end up having sex. after, she tells me my buddy has been depressed and calling her a lot lately. fuck. me. i'm gonna have to tell my second friend what happened and he's gonna hate me. i can't believe i did this. i feel like a piece of shit.

383,"being a horny teenager in the summer who recently discovered the joys of premium porn sites can lead to some very awkward scenarios. this is one of them.

i was watching some of the best shit i'd ever seen (i'm talking brazzers true life hd at 1080p and the like, there's just no going back), when i decided it was time to fap. i was lying down on my bed, sonar mode engaged (one earbud in, one out) face down, fapping away, just on the verge of climaxing when i heard footsteps nearby. i threw the ipad under the bed and tried to hold it in while i pretended i was just getting up from a nap or whatever. well, while i was getting up, my dick brushed up against my thigh or my pants or something, then i knew i wasn't going to be able to control it. 

my dad does this thing where he will randomly tell me that he loves me, sometimes with a hug, and i really don't mind it, i'll even say it back and all. but this time, this time as he hugs me i can just feel myself coming in my pants, while i awkwardly maintain my crotch as far away from his body as humanly possible.

 

the good news is, i don't think he knew what had happened, i like to think that the sweatpants hid the boner and that he didn't notice my weird hip position.","i came. while hugging my dad. while struggling to say ""me too"" without sounding like an incestuous homosexual."

i was so focused on not pushing down that i didn't even consider this as a possibility for ruining the lcd.

so i hadn't run in about 3 weeks. already i fucked up, but i took it to a new level today. out of shape, nervous, anxious, and full of pee, i stepped up to the group of girls preparing for the race. the gun sounds and i know that shit is about to hit the fan. i tried to keep up with the leading runners, oblivious to their varsity status. on the first lap, i wasted all my energy. alright, maybe i could make up for it by cutting back a bit. comfortably in the middle of the pack, i started hyperventilating and got a side stitch. shit. there i was, halfway done, barely making it, and i just noped out of the race. tears, walking, more hyperventilating, just the epitome of a screw up. an encouraging runner ran up beside me and helped me stick it out; however, i couldn't help but stop every once it a while. one lap to go and i am practically dead. my bladder had enough, too, as i began to piss with every impact. i finished 43rd out of ~50. ...at least i wasn't last?

i quickly lost all interest on my final and try to ask the prof if i can be excused for bathroom. did a walk of shame all the way to the bathroom while clenching whatever mess i still had brewed inside. turns out the shit stained my shorts. i made a couple calls and mom comes after 30 mins with a fresh pair.","shat pants during a final, dont know i passed the class or not.**"
387,"i awoke this morning to feel the guy i'm seeing pushing up behind me, indicating it was time for some morning sex. 

his a/c wasn't working, so it had become extremely stuffy and hot overnight. i decide to turn the fan on high, and proceed to jump on top. bad idea.

nsfw details aside, while on top of him i begin to feel uncomfortable as i go through the motions. i realize about half-way in that the fan blowing on high is blowing directly onto where our body's intertwined. 

the combination of wetness, air and the up-and-down motion starts making a few sounds here and there. i shrug it off, and continue. at this point, i can really feel the air being pumped up me, so i suggest we switch to doggy.

this is where i regret turning on that machine sent from the devil. he gets behind me, and the blowing air somehow makes me feel even worse from this position. 

suddenly, what sounds like a massive trumpet note blares from my vagina. he keeps going, but i could tell he hesitated a second.

now, being the class-act that i am, i find this noise absolutely hilarious. i try to hold in the laughter as he is about to finish. he pulls out, and i can hold it no longer -- i begin to laugh out loud.

with each incessant exhale of laughter from my mouth comes an equally loud exhale of air from my vagina. i laugh harder as the ""quieffs"" get louder and louder.

i kid you not when i say that i laughed for a solid 45 seconds straight while my vagina made uncontrollable, extremely loud farting sounds. 

this wouldn't have been so bad if i hadn't been the only one who found this amusing . . .

cue the awkward tension as i try with all my might to stop the laughter and thus stop the morbid sounds escaping my vagina.

needless to say, we finish up, and lay in utter awkward silence until i finally manage to say, ""well, i should head out.""

389,"i hate itchy, wiry pubic hairs. having lice in your hair is one thing - but having a constant itch in your pubes? insufferable! so that's why i always make sure to properly groom my pubic hairs - i treat them as if they're my own children, and i gently caress them whenever they want company. surely i'm not the only one who does this...

so yesterday, right before a date with my girlfriend, i took out the shampoo and prepared myself to send the pubic hair itch back to hell where it belonged. so i generously applied the shampoo, rinsed the pubes in a hurry, and left for my date. a few minutes later, my pubes have become rock hard. it wasn't shampoo - it was gel, and my pubes were so stiff that walking was painful. my gf asked me if i was sick or something, because i was walking like a penguin who just got shot in the crotch. at the end of the date, i could barely walk home with her, and she was getting really suspicious. i asked her if i could see her next week, but she said ""i don't know"" (in other words, no way).",i accidentally applied gel instead of shampoo to my pubic hairs. now my girlfriend won't go out with me. :'(
390,"we've all had those ""well, it sounded fine at the time..."" moments, and just a few short months ago, the time had come for me to add another rather memorable incident to that list.  
i live in an medium sized apartment complex fairly close to my college campus, and my roommate frequently has people over from his fraternity. on this particular friday night, it was a ""smaller"" group (of about ten to fifteen people) that were over to have a good time. it was a typical get together: blaring music, snacks, and many, *many* drinks. and after a couple hours of raging (at about two in the morning), the group had opted to head up to the roof to take a break from partying.  
now, this is where i come in. i'm not a frat guy nor a ""partier"", but i was also no stranger to the party scene. i can hold my own in conversation and dress just fine. and on this night, i had decided that i might as well get some fresh air and break out both my room and my shell for once. *maybe i can meet some new people, they seem pretty cool to me,* i thought. *what could go wrong?* so i optimistically join the group and head up to the roof, with the purpose of enjoying the austin skyline on a cozy texas summer night with some new friendly faces. that sentiment wouldn't last long.    
we head up the elevator, walk to the center of the roof and sit in a large circle. the group begins talking about this and that, mostly about personal topics that i couldn't really chime in on. as i observe the inebriated and rather spacey group, i suddenly catch a guy playfully poking the breast of the girl next to him, like one would play with a small kitten. she had been drinking, so she didn't mind much. he continued to play with her breast, and then loudly and deliberately asked ""is.. is your right one bigger than your left one?"" she briefly thought it over before slowly replying, ""no... they're the same, aren't they? is one of them bigger?""  
now just hours before, i had read a [til about how your left breast is generally bigger than your right breast because of its proximity to the heart.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1deo9k/til_your_left_boob_is_usually_bigger_than_the/) so what better time to share this piece of information than two in morning with a bunch of intoxicated strangers? *why, there's no better time!*, i apparently thought, because without missing a beat, i suddenly looked her square in the eyes and declared: ""it's definitely your left one.""  
this made the group instantly quiet for the first time the entire night. but before i could get out my follow-up statement, about how i was speaking from memory rather than with my dick, the group loudly reacted in an variety of ways, including ""what the hell?"", drunken hysterical laughter, and finally, my roommate leaning over and whispering ""the guy poking her is her boyfriend.""  
through the ensuing wave of noise and stares a manage to blurt out ""it's because of the heart, it's a science thing!"", which served as trying to put a bandaid over my socially sliced jugular. i just continued to sit there like a statue, trying to sink into the floor while simultaneously avoiding the drunken laser stare from the boyfriend i felt from my peripherals. he was not amused by my antics nor my little follow-up, and he was certainly in no condition to be reasoned with, either. to make things even better, he was easily one hundred pounds heavier than myself. so, when after a couple of moments he started to approach me, i quickly responded by saying to the group ""i'm going to hit the bathroom."" which consisted of me going back to my room in my apartment and not coming out until the morning, and consequently vowing to somehow convince them that i wasn't a creeper, stalker or a rapist.  
i haven't seen any of them since.",edit: almost got pulverized and by a massive drunken boyfriend thanks to a til.**
391,"it all started innocent enough; i was hanging out with the roommates, smoking, enjoying myself. after getting to what felt like a [7] i got a very unexpected burst of energy. i decided that i was going to be productive. 

as i'm standing in my hallway, i'm trying to remember what needs to be done but instead my eyes kept focused on the phallic shaped dent in the wall. so, like any sane person, i began giggling and like any person as high as i was, i forgot to swallow my spit. i snapped out of my dick dent trance in time to stop myself from drooling. i said ""high five"" out loud in an effort to high five myself which actually confused me. the encouragement felt nice though. this is the moment i realized that i may have exceeded the traditional 1-10 scale of intoxication. i was at a [10+]. i had momentary reservation about going through with the productivity but decided to yolo the fuck out and do some laundry. 

now, our laundry room is shared between a few apartments on our block. there is one washer and one dryer inside. so i take off all my sheets and fill my laundry basket with sheets and bras and shit. you know, laundry type shit. 

i was incredibly slow paced but successful nonetheless at the first few loads. 

the last load of laundry is what triggered some very unexpected events. i went to put the last load into the dryer and i notice that i had washed the entire box of 100 dryer sheets in the washing machine right on top of all the aforementioned laundry shit. i did my best to fix the situation. 
i'd like to take a moment to say that the soaked dryer sheets smelled heavenly. it was like lavender and fresh rain made sweet love and their jizz consisted of wet cardboard fragments. i was okay with this. 

as my yoloing continued, i threw the laundry shit into the dryer, paid the machine, pressed start and headed back to smoke a little more. an hour later i go back to discover that the lavender/fresh rain cardboard fragment jizz is incredibly flammable. the dryer is smoking and i decide that i don't want to yolo ever again. i grab my shit from the dryer and get into my apartment. 

we do not live in the nicest part of town. at all. we live in what has been deemed ""the ghetto"" by some. quite literally in the middle of black gang and hispanic gang territory (they are a violent group of frenemies). 

i can hear my neighbors near the laundry room yelling, ""what dumb ass nigga put mother fucking cardboard boxes in this bitch"" 

*i was the dumbass nigga.*

another voice shouts ""god damn juan we know it was you nigga where the fuck you at"" 

*it wasn't juan. it was me.*

i hear juan shout a few racist insults. more and more people begin showing up, it gets louder. people are yelling at each other about who the fuck tried to wash and dry an entire cardboard box. 

i decide to go fold laundry in the farthest part of my apartment with my basket full of sheets, bras and burnt cardboard. 

a few moments later, a fight broke out. the police were called. nobody was hurt. i put my clean sheets on and watched reruns of its always sunny trying to forget about how everything was my fault and now our block has no working laundry room.","had a few marijuanas, yoloed, almost caused a race war"
392,"so my best friend's place needed to have the insulation replaced in their attic. as payment for said job, his mom paid me and my two friends with rammstein pit tickets. so far, awesome.

we go to the concert and it is one of the best concerts any of us have ever been to. they go into mein teil and till is covered in blood and in full on butcher's garb. the song ends and we are rocking our faces off. the next song starts and people start throwing things into the audience from the front (i'm assuming that it's the fans throwing random things they brought).

i then see a black dot fly into the air coming straight in my direction and i catch it like any good fan would. now, to me the thing that landed in my hands feels like (and don't ask my why i though of this) a plastic bag filled with poop. i then proceed to throw it behind me in surprise and disgust. then the flames come up from the stage and light up the room so i can now see my hands covered in fake blood and i realize that i have just thrown away till's knotted up, blood covered, butchers glove. i then proceed to fall to my knees in despair and chalk that moment up to one of the most regretted moments of my entire life; right behind my crazy ex girlfriend.",i threw away a blood covered glove at a rammstein concert that was being worn by till thinking it was a bag of poo.
393,"i work on dirt roads and recently we got some precipitation which of course caused the roads to become muddy. with the mud caked all over and in my pickup it started to shake badly at highway speed and so i was trying to take the caps off to see if some of the lugs were loose so i used what i had in my hands, my keys, to pry one of them off. bent the key. well i have this tool box full of keys so i was just going to bend it back. yeah a little over an hour and a hundred dollars later i was able to drive home.",i f'ed up by bending my truck key and then trying to straighten it.
394,"not so recently, my grandma was put into a personal care home due to a broken hip and both of her daughters just not having the time to be able to care for her as she needs to be. more recently, the pitbull that the couple who run this home has had a litter of puppies. out of the 8, 7 survived and 1 of those is the second smallest of the litter. she is extremely shy and the mother extremely protective of her. i decided i was going to name all of the pups and get the owners of the care home to start calling each pup by the name i had given them. there is chewie, shiva, alfalfa, spanky, sugar plum, tommy, and finally, the focus of my fuck up, fluttershy. she is the center of my social experiment. since these pups will soon be fit to be taken away from their mother, i was going to use shy as a way to figure out a rough estimate as to how many bronies live in my area, outside of high school and college, by how many prospective adopters catch on to the name. the fact that the pup is named after a pony from a tv show escaped from everyone, until today, when, in a discussion about amnesia, i mention alois from the justine dlc of amnesia. both of my brothers ask who he is and i explain to them the previous information and am met with blank looks. i explain to them again as follows:

""yeah, you remember, they took fluttershy (the pony, not the pup) and made her into him in 'a small horse?'"" (a custom story for amnesia for those who don't know)

and that's when they connected the dots and questioned after my reasons for naming a beautiful and shy little pitbull pup after an animated pony from a tv show.",i attempted an incognito social experiment to estimate to see how many bronies live in my area and got it blown wide open by way of discussion of video games.
395,"so it was the later hours and our shift was just about to end when a workmate comes up and asks me if the others are bothering me, and i answer yes since i think he isn't serious... but he was and he started to talk about how much he doesn't like that i get joked around with (witch i'm totally ok with) and how bad the work-atmosphere is compared to other places he has been, so we talk a bit about it and from what i i can tell he would like to tell them to fuck and get away from him...

fast forward one hour and i'm in the car on my way home and i get a phone call from the work-leader who told me he had with the guy from before that i was tired of their crap and was done being bullied... and this was not how i expected it to be so now there is a shitstorm brewing and i fear for the one who was ""protecting"" me will get shit for this and worst case loose his work...

396,"so last night i was at a guy friend's house.  we were drinking a few beers....i was drunk. (he was not drunk, hadn't had as much as me)

i got up to go to the bathroom, thought i just had to pee.  once sitting on the toilet i decided i had to poop; being drunk, i thought it was a *great* idea to poo.  because the string of my tampon got a little ""dirty"", i took it out. he didn't have a trashcan in there, so i dropped it in the toilet and flushed. 

i quickly discovered the water was not going down, and was indeed filling the bowl and going all over the floor.  in my drunken state, i just stared at the overflowing toilet as the shit water gathered around my feet.  i came out and told him i need a plunger, that the toilet wasn't flushing.

he ran to turn off the water to the toilet; i plunged and the water went down.

i was so embarrassed i just went to play xbox while he said ""i'm going to light a candle"" and turned the bathroom fan on (obviously, it smelled like shit).

his drunk roommate came out and made a scene that it smelled and that i'd made a huge mess.  they had to get a shop vac to clean up the water; they went to walmart (at 1am, after i'd left) to buy new power cords for (some machines, i'm not sure what) in the room next to the bathroom, since i'd flooded that room too.",: flushed a tampon after shitting (at a guy's house); flooded two rooms and caused damage.
397,"we know we have all done it in a bit of hurry, put item on top of car, grab it, throw thing in car when done with car hand seat things.

well this time not so much. dropped off the 3.5 year old daughter at mom's house. put said ipad on top of the ""crossover man its a cross over"" take all pink things, cuz like the ipad has, err had, the nice super  otterbox in the super pink, anyway it was pink and help her out of the car with all the things. close the door. (its windy tx got snap cold this morning) and help her and all the pink items, teddy bear (pink) some super blanket of leia angry birds hoody blanket and ipad. or so i had in my head. off to the front door of mom's and i'm back in the car off to work late and thinking of all the things i could have mentioned or said when i hear a thump. well i get on the highway for my commute to work and i am thinking what was the thump. ohh the computer in the back bay hit something, or it was a lug nut or whatever. (111kmiles on this driver thing)

so i am close to downtown and like three miles from work, which we all know when you work downtown at a big city like dallas, you know you have to have a bit of wait time. no one can drive correctly. the empty gas tank light has been on like for the last 20 miles of your 18mpg car. and you know you got like 4 miles left plus the idle and all the stress there kicks in. 

must get to work, its almost 10am and that is my normal thursday morning time on the nights i have the daughter on the you know wednesday. so i drive into a ""7-11"" get out of the car and notice. you forgot your wallet. so now i am trying to figure out if i have enough gas to go like three measly more blocks and another mile or two up inside the corkscrew parking garage. make it to work on time(ish) and get cash and drive back to get gas. so i open the passenger side front door, to see if maybe it(my wallet) fell out of a bag or i set it down out of my jacket for some odd reason. 

that is when the realization took hold. 

it was a grip unlike anything in my life. the bright pink otterbox front cover/stand fell off the passenger seat in a ultimately slow motion method and onto the grey concrete making the deepest darkest rattling thud into guilt you could never conceive of. at the same time as it rattles on the ground history played through my eyes of the events that transpired up to this moment. as if i had died. and the realization of the fact she didn't take the ipad into the house, it was the fluffy things, and dad, dad!!! left the ipad on the roof, and dad heard it thumpingly hit the rear bumper while getting on the highway, it was dad. dad, guilty dad!

as all of these events rush through, finally gaining some composure ( felt like i was standing there staring at this pink square on the ground for an hour) i put some gas in and then park the car in the garage get to work, share my anguish and try to find a method to the madness. but none came. i got the gas thing fixed, but i was delaying the true gut wrenching feeling i was having inside.

it was guilt, guilt at a level i have never experienced! i felt like i was 12 about trying to rationalize a lie to my mother about something i didn't really know why it was wrong. then it hit. all these things inm my head and how do i explain it to my three year old daughter. what, what am i going to do. well i shared it with co workers of course. that is totally sane right. i was hiding it. it kept creeping, the guild see she (daughter) has had this in her hands since she could hold it. i picked up the tablet so i could do work and internet while laying in that awesome nifty fold out seat they have at hospitals for while mommy is getting better after birth. my daughter has had to see her first dog make his way to the big park a few weeks ago and this in my feelings going to crush her again. (so the guilt keeps telling me) and this one, ugh, it is like another pet just left too. shes learning her 123, and abc on it and pbs channel thing is like a helping hand while visiting family. it is her other sibling

it took a few hours (for the despair to set in) but i called her mommy and asked her to go check the road maybe it was alive somewhere or even in pieces. so i could get some closure, so i knew i had no other choice but to say, ""the pink tablet is gone too."" about 3pm i get a update the tablet was nowhere to be seen.

ill stop there. i have gone through so many emotional ups and downs. it is crazy. i get the daughter tomorrow and see how bad it is. but it feels like my first big tifu when it comes to the daughter. thanks for sharing.

398,"so i'm a girl. and today i'm wearing skinny jeans and a lace thong. yes, this does have to do with my fuck up, i'm not just trying to turn you on. so i'm sitting in class with my legs crossed and i somehow get a really bad front wedgie when i stand up from my desk (see, i told you i wasn't turning you on.) so i leave class and as i walk back to my residence, this wedgie problem is getting worse and worse. i am in a ton of pain, so i'm trying to wiggle around while i walk, with great success- i could barely notice it now! so i get back to residence and i'm lying on my bed when i feel the urge to go to the washroom. as i'm pulling my pants down, i experience the worst amount of pain i have gone through in a while. it felt like someone just pierced my lady business. i let out a shriek and look down and notice a pool of blood forming, as well as a piece of what looks like rubber. i sit down and as i'm peeing i'm freaking out, trying to figure out what the rubber is, when i realize the toilet is full of blood. the piece of rubber turned out to be part of my ""labs"", which i had ripped a chunk out of. i guess what had happened is in class, part of the lab got stuck in the lace of my thong, as i walked i further got it stuck, and when i pulled down my thong, it ripped that part right off. i now am no longer able to walk, and am throwing this underwear out right away.","female front wedgie turns into bloody, ripped labia mess."
399,"small backstory: i'm in my second year at university, majoring in art. i had an assignment about six weeks ago that i managed to persuade a friend of mine to model for me. she agreed provided that i didn't draw her face. she came over to my house, stripped down and posed for me. it was a complicated piece that was going to have several poses from her arranged in a particular way. but she started to get tired after about an hour. on her suggestion, i took photographs of her in the required poses and loaded them on to her laptop so that i could draw from them and then delete them when i was done and that if i needed any additional detail she could pose again but at least it wouldn't be as tiring. the work would still be done in a day but she'd be more comfortable while i worked.

this was fine except that while she went out to the bathroom or to get something to eat etc. i copied the photos from her computer onto a usb drive. partly so i would have them in case i needed to edit later and shamefully, because she is also quite attractive. she never noticed, the work was finished and she deleted the photos thinking that they were gone forever. i thanked her and left, and things went back to normal.

i didn't think it was safe to leave the memory stick in my house as i couldn't guarantee that one of my roommate's wouldn't find it and look at it so i kept it with me. the photos were buried pretty deeply on the drive so i could use it safely around the place. until today.

i got a call while i was working on an essay in the library and rushed off. i thought i put everything away safely but a few hours later i realized that the drive was not in my bag at all and that i had no memory of removing it from the computer. i went back but there was no sign of it and no-one handed it in at the desk.

i'm freaking out right now. my friend will freak out if these photos are leaked. it will probably kill her. i've abused her trust and she's going to pay for it. i can't tell (i just can't have that conversation with her) but i hate the thought of these being passed around and her just being blind sided by it.",", i lost a usb drive with nude photos of my friend that i went behind her back to get, and don't know what to do now.**"

401,"well this was actually on saturday night but it is still fucking me up today lol but here it goes: 
  i was at a halloween party where i have gone to the past couple years and randomly go there for parties throughout the year. my night was going grand and dandy, talking to the girl i have a crush on, and getting steadily fucked up. but my buddy had brought along some apple pie moonshine that was delicious. i'm known for not being able to handle my alcohol sometimes so i knew that the shine was not in my favor. anyways, there were some tough guys starting stuff with people, didn't have halloween costumes on, and were black. i'm not normally a racist individual, but something that night made me racist lol. i walk up, (keep in mind that i dressed up in a penguin costume) they all start saying shit and i grow the biggest pair of testicles and say ""shut up, nigger!"" and slap one of them in the face. also keep in mind i'm not a very big dude (5'9"" 135lbs). they rage in anger and follow me outside and i proceed to get jumped by 3 giant black dudes. i woke up the next day and couldn't remember anything about it and my clothes were completely covered in blood.",don't drink moonshine.
402,"so i'm an idiot. there's this girl that lives across the hall from me that often makes me partake in activities with her. i try not to give in too much but i'm a moron and so when she invites me to partake in long, four hour activities riddled with social interaction i say: fuck the essay i have due to tomorrow, i'll just take a gigantic swig of whiskey so i can deal with my social anxiety and enjoy the next little while.

by the time i'm done with the activity i'm ready to work again, but regrettably i'm still drunk (because i'm a fucking moron) and i'm seriously lacking in time. so what do i do? fill my body with more harmful liquids! i went out and bought a lot of red bull. in the past 12 hours i've consumed 7 red bulls and a 5 hour energy thing. i'm pretty sure the essay i've just written is completely incomprehensible but i can't tell because my mind is too fucked to recognize what does and does not make sense. like how can i be so stupid? want to know what i did yesterday morning instead of writing my essay? i'll show you:

i added random games to my steam library and found or created tiles for them so i could look at my games in grid view and admire how pretty they were. i must be a new breed of moron.

so now i'm sitting here in the dark with my heart beating fast enough that i can actually hear it. my essay is due in about six hours from now and i can't go to sleep to refresh my mind because i'm too hopped up on caffeine and i can't write for shit because i'm going to have the mental capacity and literacy skills of a chain smoking toddler until i get some rest. hell i bet even the stuff i'm writing *right now* doesn't make sense.

i can't tell if the pains in my chest are stress related or if my heart is just getting ready to give out. oh well, i guess i earned this. maybe i'll do some jumping jacks and help the little sucker out. would certainly solve *one* of my problems.

 

**update:**

so i fell on my bed and prayed for about 20 minutes. i'm not the religious type but i basically said i'd do volunteer work if the g man delivered me through the day unscathed. i lay down to try and nap and i kept getting graphic sexual images in my head and i was totally convinced it was god testing me. i still have faith that he will help me because those were some seriously graphic images and my member remains unwanked. so anyway i just woke up with 3 hours until my essay is due. my kidney hurts, my tongue feels like a cheese grater and my mouth tastes uncannily like my own blood. yes, my essay is pretty retarded. i appear to have started paragraphs and then gotten frustrated at myself before mashing enter until i didn't have to look at them anymore so i have lots of useless crap at my disposal... also my word count is therefore a total lie.

still not a good day, friends.

**update2:**

oh god my neighbor is texting me, talking about how she didn't want to be up all night worrying about me. she says she *likes me* but my lack of maturity regarding my work and liberal consumption of alcohol and energy drinks (further adding to my immaturity) is what kills her interest. i don't even want her to like me. what the shit.

**update3:**

sitting in lecture right near the front. the energy drink shits are brewing vigorously. i'm not gonna make it until the end and i'm worried if i get up and leave my prof will make a comment and everyone will look at me and i'll shit myself in fear. i can't even pay attention to what he's saying. why am i even here?

**update4:**

i'm going to do a final update for those still lingering. i just slept for 14 hours, right through all my classes. the girl professed her affections for me... no idea why.

403,"been lurking this sub about as long as i've been on reddit, finally made an account and then decided to contribute. i never really thought i had a fuckup bad enough to warrant putting up, but i thought about it for a while and this one qualifies i think. this happened when i was a freshman in high school so about 8 years ago now. 

when i was a freshman i was in jrotc (junior reserve officers' training corps) and every wednesday we had to wear our uniforms to school, we would have a dress inspection, the whole shebang. during the colder months we would wear our full class a's with the jacket. our inspections required a white undershirt and black socks specifically, and i only had a couple white t-shirts of the type that we needed. sometimes i would just throw on a wrinkled one just because i didn't have a fresh clean one ready. you can probably start to see where this is going. 

now, at the time, i had these two cats, and they were good cats but sometimes they could be real pricks. they would piss on piles of laundry (especially if it was fresh, sitting on top of the washer folded, even) for no reason most of the time, and especially when they were agitated about something. they were sneaky bastards too, for obvious reasons, so we never caught them in the act. my cat in particular was an expert at opening the doors in my house so he would get in my shit and fucking piss on it. 

so it's a wednesday, i wake up and quickly take a shower, start putting on my uniform and getting ready for the day. i am looking around for a white t-shirt and the only one i see is a wrinkled ball of white sitting on my dirty laundry hamper where i had tossed it a week before. i grab it, throw it on, put on my dress shirt, my tie, my jacket and run out the door to catch the bus. sitting on the bus i am already getting faint whiffs of piss odor, but i don't dwell on it. the connection hadn't been made yet. 

i had phys ed 4th period of the day, jrotc 5th. throughout the day i had these inklings of something that stank, but my stupid brain doesn't associate it to me. occasionally i can tell other people are aware of it and are seeking the source as well, but still i am oblivious. it isn't until phys ed that i realize my mistake. half the day had already passed. 

the worst part, in my opinion, is that i didn't realize it until i had come back to the locker room from pe. i had changed entirely out of my uniform into a different shirt and shorts. it wasn't until i was putting my uniform back on, when i threw on the white shirt and tucked it into my pants as i pulled them up, that my friend in pe who was changing nearby looked up and said, ""dude!!"" and started laughing... my other friend looked up and started laughing as well... the smell was suddenly so obvious to me, i couldn't believe i hadn't noticed it earlier. 

i looked down and my shirt was covered with dry cat piss all over the right shoulder and chest, underarm... it was horrible. i ripped it off and threw it to the floor as my friends died of laughter. no one else in the locker room seemed to notice what was happening so that was good, and i quickly retreated to the lost and found bin and found an oversized white shirt i could use that had the added advantage of not being covered in piss. 

i wonder how many people knew that it was me that stank of piss, or that it was in fact piss. i wondered if they could see it. most likely. i managed to live that down and at least i didn't go to inspection with a piss-soaked shirt on, but that was probably my biggest fuckup ever. and i was just a freshman, i had to work hard to bury that and not have the fucking worst high school experience ever. anyways that's my story, thanks for reading folks.","went to school for 3 periods with a piss-soaked undershirt on, realized in phys ed, got a lot of shit for it."
404,"so essentially, my girlfriend had her friend over last night (12/31/12) to celebrate new years. fun times were had by all. before the friend went to bed, she got a glass of water and set it beside the desk.

now let's get all wibbly wobbly timey-wimey. my gf got a used desktop in exchange for baby-sitting for her bosses, and she's been promised this one for a while but they just finally got around to it. so i've been doing work on it like wiping the drive, and i was going to swap my old parts in there. hp listed the case as atx when it was micro-atx, so for now she was stuck with what it came with. i tried re-installing windows 7 and just won't fucking do it. the previous owner swapped the sata drive with a ata drive connected to a raid ide pci card. for those not computer savvy, these things are condensed evil. 

so today after the friend left, i was semi-successful using a side-loader for windows to install but it never booted. so i said fuck it, ubuntu live cd for now until the new sata drive arrives. she played with it and had fun, then set the computer to sleep.

now, our old cat was being more playful than usual. earlier when he was in my lap, i set my leatherman on my desk and out of nowhere the cat just does this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=b_mvb-g1v1i#t=8s with it. so i place the cat somewhere else.

fast forward to 1:30 am. i'm setting up dd-wrt on a router for a wireless bridge for my ps3. the cat wants to be in my lap, but i'm sitting in my chair by my desk, with a laptop on my lap and a router on the other chair. so the cat decides to jump onto my girlfriend's desk and **clack** *splash*. the cat knocked over the cup of water.

you wanna know something about hp media centers? they have this neat tower setup where the top compartment has a dvd storage thingy that slides. this was open. this leads inside the case.

oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck get the towels

i switch off the power immediately and unplug the computer and tilt it strategically.

and now i play the waiting game to see if my girlfriend's computer was ruined by the cat.

i have hope because before the power was shut off, the computer didn't have any smoke, no sparks, and the front power button was doing the glowing amber low power sleep mode slow flashing. besides, all she needs is an atx case and a power supply for her new computer if this one is busted.

405,"ok, so the heat in my house is provided by a wood burning stove. today i was lazy and didn't want to make a fire so i decided to plug in my space heater. apparently i have too many things plugged into the same power line and when i turned it on, the circuit breaker would flip (a new project for the future). so i picked the next best outlet, the one that my fluorescent lights are plugged into.

after realizing that i had to have the switch to the outlet on in order to have my space heater on, i figured all i needed to do was give the bulbs a half a turn to break the circuit and i could sleep in darkness.

i start to slowly twist the first bulb waiting for the satisfying click, but was dumbfounded that it didn't rest into a designated slot. either way the bulb wasn't moving and was off. i started to twist the 2nd bulb. still wondering why the light didn't have a specific way to turn it off without a switch.

eventually i get to a point where i start thinking ""i should really be doing this in the center and with 2 hands, just in case it falls out.."" as soon as i finish that sentence in my head, the bulb pops out and hits the corner of my shelf, shattering into a million tiny pieces.

shards are now littering my bed and surrounding carpet. it was at that moment i realize, the whole light fixture is plugged in and i could have just simply unplugged it...

406,"first off, let me explain the situation i am living with right now. i have a family friend living with me, he has aids, hep c, and some type of kidney cancer, all from homosexual intercourse. he is very poor (can't find a job that will hire him with those diseases, he used to be a hair stylist.) anyway, he is living with us because he can't afford rent, he has been doing this for the past year. so he is sleeping in my computer room, and often times, i forget he is even there. this is why i fucked up.

i was playing some counterstrike on a very competitive server. of course, since i am trash at all video games, i was losing, hard. so as any other normal person would do, i would criticize the other players, (by criticize i mean scream very rude and insulting things over the mic, be it threats, encouragement for suicide, or calling the person gay in some form.) so as all this was going on i did not notice he was in the bed behind me. eventually, after what seemed like hours, the map ended and i stopped playing. i turned around and i saw him, this was probably the most awkward situation i have ever been in, even more so than the time i was getting kissed from a big group of special needs children. anyway, i start going off with every apology i know, he is sitting there crying, with laughter. i still feel terrible.

407,"it started off like any other day; wake up, get my clothes on, brush my teeth, head out. the rest of my day was relatively average up until the time i got home. my mom asked me if i could paint my sister's old room so that it would cover of the awful design and ungodly amounts of blood on the walls. (another story for another time) now i'm not normally a guy who does anything even remotely related to interior design or home decorating or whatever you want to call the shit that makes your home look pretty, but i figured painting a little 10x10 room shouldn't be too hard. i got all my paint tools and whatnot, put some paint in the pan and started rollin' my roller from wall to wall. i didn't stop to think that maybe, with what seems to be the strongest smelling paint in all paintdom, i should have some kind of clean air flowing through this tiny ass room. an hour rolls by and i start to think something may be wrong when i realize i'm basically lying down painting sideways and giggling like a giddy schoolgirl. this is where i begin to understand where i fucked up. i'm more light headed than a heroin addict sucking up helium and can't manage to walk in a straight line to save my life. not only that, but i managed to get paint everywhere and i mean everywhere. my arms, my hands, the walls, the back of the cat's head, it was bad. the paint won't come off either, and there's no paint thinner or anything around. so here i am, halfway on my high horse when two people decide to show up. my father, who has a ""i hate everyone and i don't give a damn."" attitude, and my mother who despises anything that reminds here of drugs. when they get home is when the fun starts. my mom freaks out asking if i'm using her house as a hideaway hole for nefarious drug purposes and starts lecturing me about how ""drugs are bad mmkay."" she finally stops talking and i get a chance to ask my dad how to get paint off of me without paint thinner, but it doesn't exactly come out right and i don't remember exactly what i said but his response was ""gasoline"". i told myself ""this can't possibly have any negative repercussions"" and grabbed the gas can from the garage and essentially took a bath. did i mention my father is an asshole with a twisted sense of humor? he came outside and started clicking a damn lighter at me saying ""hope it don't catch!"" so here i sit, still feeling the paint killing my brain cells at a steady pace and praying i'll wake up in the morning.",painted a tiniest of tiny rooms with a paint that had the smelliest of smells and managed to get high off my ass and almost lit on fire.
408,"**this is really long - you might just want to skip to the tl;dr**

so yesterday by 9:30 i was really tired and decided to get ready for bed (normally i go to bed 11 or later). i think i probably fell asleep a little after 10 but randomly woke up around 1am and couldn't fall back to sleep. at 2:05 i decided to just get up and do stuff because it was clear i wasn't going to fall asleep anytime soon. got on my laptop, played some dishonored, went on reddit (have you read [the story of her holding an orange](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10nadn/i_am_a_grown_logical_man_crying_tears_of_horror/)? it's quite good), whatever.

i have class at 8:30 on mondays, so i usually get up around 7:30 - time enough to shower, pack up my stuff, and grab a quick breakfast - but since i was already up i took my shower around 6:30, moseyed around reddit a little longer, and then went and chatted with people in the student center until the caf opened at 7:30. when it opened, i found some friends to sit with and made myself a nice bowl of generic froot loops and a cup of this french vanilla coffee their cappuccino machine hacks up - i only drink the kind of coffee that is a disgrace to the name of coffee, you see.

normally this stuff is pretty good, albeit rich, but today it was sort of weird. i ignored it, though, because i was already five or six hours into a 3-hour-sleep day. i had two cups at breakfast and then a big mug throughout my first class to make sure i stayed awake. (caffeine wears off pretty fast for me but as long as i can pick it up and take another sip i'll keep going.) when i got out of class around 9:40, i finished off the dregs and went to the bathroom to rinse out my mug and take a dump.

usually i hardly have to wipe and don't drop a deuce more than once a day - less, if anything. this one was a bit softer than usual, but not too much, and it was a big'un, so i figured that'd keep my colon happy for a while. i went to my next class and took a test (c++, ooh boy) and then walked back to my room and nap. my roommate decided to make me go to lunch/elevensies with him instead of sleep, but i just had water because i had a stomacheache starting to get bad. halfway back to our room i realized i probably just hadn't eaten enough for the time i'd been up (it was about 11:15) and the amount of coffee i'd had. when we got there, i felt a need to go to the super bowl and drop trou again - twice in under two hours, a big warning sign for me - and this time the product of my labors was smaller and even softer. i had to wipe way more than i usually do and it was a humbling experience for me, a one-wipe man.

my stomach was still bemoaning my poor food choices for the day, so i had a quick snack - snyder's of hanover, bacon and cheddar flavor - but before long, my stomachache came back. this time i thought i'd had too much, but then i needed to visit the loo again. this was the worst yet: a leaky faucet clogged with soggy pieces of popcorn chicken. you know when you get a hot fudge sundae from dq and eat all the fudge, and then you're left with a bunch of melted soft serve and small, soft chunks of dying ice cream? that's basically what it was. that cappuccino crap turned out to be drano for the human digestive system and now i'm sitting here dreading the potential for another anal leakage.",guzzled more than half a liter of drano sapiens**
409,"some background; i'm staying at my grandma's for some exams in the local uni and my uncle (who's living here, also) asked me to do a website to improve one of his assignments and each time he would talk to me about it i would tell him how i feel 'bout it :

it's complicated, i don't have the tools to do it and mainly, i don't want to do it and spend some time on it. (man, it would take  a lot of time)

i must specify : i'm on holidays and my second session of exams (just finished the first one) is beginning in less than 10 days. needless to say, i don't want to bother about some of this stuff.

well i figured (since once people think you're good with computers you're some kind of divinity who can do anything comp related in a wink) i would say ""no"" for once. he tried to make me feel bad about it and now him and my grandma are giving me the &#3232;\_&#3232; face cause apparently [i have the time since i'm only playing games on mah computer...](http://arch.413chan.net/feelsbadman-\(n1305563518441\).jpg)

411,"my girlfriend is a vegan, and i am very much so a carnivore. she respects my decision as much as i respect hers, but she wanted me to try it for a day or two. i don't know if any of you know what quinoa is, but it's a grain kind of like rice but its healthier and has a lot of fiber. she made me a whole 5 course vegan meal with vegetables, and lots of quinoa. lots. and i ate it all, as it is quite delicious. but apparently my gi tract wasn't quite happy without any meat (i eat meat at every meal, usually) and i ended up having to shit super bad. we were at her moms house, so i excused myself and went to the bathroom. i kid you not, my shit was like paste. (this was my third day of quinoa...) then out comes this giant turd the size of a large kiwi fruit. obviously the toilet ends up clogging and of course there is no plunger. so i casually stroll into the kitchen and frantically start looking for something. then i see it. salad tongs. i went back to the toilet, grabbed the turd and put it in the trash can. then, being the gent i am, took out her garbage, but then being the idiot that i am, forgot to dispose of the fecal tongs. i left them in the kitchen sink. girlfriends mom says ""oh there they are!"", rinses them off with just water, and puts them in the salad. needless to say i am not going to be eating the salad..... fuck.

a little backstory here, i am living with my aunt and uncle, and my uncle was deployed to sudan last month (military via un). so i had to take care of his precious prize winning birds for the winter. 

i couldn't sleep at all last night but when i woke up i just knew right then and there, i am going to hate this day. you just know!

i went to take a look at the birds, one bit the dust, the other was sent to their maker, expired, kicked the bucket, etc. etc. 11 birds dead! i don't know fucking how, i don't know how to take care of them, i panicked! 
but hey, the day wasn't over yet. my uncle's father (also a birdkeeper, like father like son) came to take a visit and was shocked! so he sent my nephew to scold me saying ""how dare you disrespect my father""

(i'm not excusing the behavior just stating a fact) now to clarify i sit in a cubicle crammed together with a bunch of other cubicles. fast forward to this afternoon and a coworker pulled me aside to warn me that other coworkers (who happened to be black) had overheard me having this conversation and she thought they may have been offended by it. fast forward another couple of hours and my supervisor pulled me into his office to tell me that a complaint hadn't been made but that i needed to watch what i said and be aware of who was around me.","i accidentally offended coworkers by saying the phrase ""that word"" and relating it to my childhood."
415,"hello fellow redditors. first time poster here. i've actually fucked up couple months ago, but only realized it today, so here you go: 

i live and work abroad, but i go back to my home country every now and then to see the family, etc.. for this purpose i have a sim card that i use there which is **not prepaid**, it's just 0€/month “plan” with nothing included and everything you use, you pay extra. (which is fine as i only use it few weeks a year) now every time i'm going home i can activate some sort of internet bundle that will give me 750mb mobile data for like 8€/month and i will then cancel the bundle once i'm back abroad. 

you can activate this bundle via web interface, text, call. i usually use web interface to activate it while i'm waiting at the airport on a departure gate. (it only takes couple minutes to activate) i do so this time as well, and i enjoy nice holiday for almost two weeks. i went to cottage, of course i'm happy to create mobile wifi hotspot for friends there as there no way to use up 750mb during those two weeks anyway. i'm sharing, downloading, uploading, posting like there's no tomorrow. after two weeks i leave the country and forget about my home sim completely.

two months later i get an email notification. “hello dear not_bezz, here's your bill for that month, it'll be **330.06€** including vat. thanks for using our services.” 

now i'm an it guy right, i've seen spam you wouldn't believe, sending an random invoice with a bank details to pay it is pretty common. people are sometimes stupid enough to pay it, if you send thousands of these, you'll get some serious money back. so i'm like “yeah, right, this is stupid.“ and about to report spam. but then i notice something. there's an unique customer number in the email and it's not likely that random spammer would know it. (it's not public, different from phone number, etc..) so i'm like yeah, let's call operator and see. (but still there's no way i made a 330€ bill during two weeks right? or did i?)

turns out the jerk mobile operator changed the web interface a tiny^tiny bit. now there's a small checkbox i didn't notice to activate the bundle now vs. activate the bundle on a beginning of next billing month. defaults to next billing month if unchecked. (used to be “activate now” with no other option) now the next billing month started about two days *after* i've returned from holidays. and that's when my bundle was also activated. so i've ended up using over 400mb of out of bundle data on a plan that charges for it like i'm roaming on a moon. and yeah i've also paid two months of completely useless bundle afterwards. so yeah, now i have to pay 330.06€ - just to compare, my usual bill is *less than* 15€/month. so it's more than two years of mobile internet/calls/text used up in less than two weeks.. 

i have to say, when i contacted the customer service department, they promised to look for some possible solution so i won't have to pay the full price. however i did use the data, i didn't have the bundle active (althought i wasn't aware of that) so technically the bill is valid and most likely i'll have to pay for my mistake.

** 

**udpate**: looks like company will send me a credit note for the used data, so i only end up paying for the two unnecessary data bundles. (about 30eur) and about 6eur spent calling customer service from abroad.. but yeah, definitely better than paying 330eur. thanks for advises guys.","**: i didn't activate a mobile internet bundle, ended up paying more for two weeks, than i've paid during last two years *combined*."

well fast-forward to day 3 in the vacation, and he decides to play with his toys at the top of the stairs. all was fine until the mother of all stomach cramps hits me (just glad this didn't become an ""i accidentally shit myself"" story). i sprinted up the stairs and was just about to reach the top when he punches me in the stomach like he's fucking lil' mac from punch out. as i fell from being punched, i lost my footing on the stairs and accidentally slapped him full force across the face. 

this tale only gets worse because due to the slap, he falls down the stairs, causing him scrapes, a black eye, and a burning hatred towards me. now i'm here, sitting on the couch of the beach house, feeling like shit as a toddler is being treated for his slap/stair bruises. i do have to admit though i feel like i have a solid future as a pimp. 


 

**update** : his aunt made him apologize to me for punching me, and also made him promise not to do that ever again. that lasted about 30 minutes. almost immediately after swearing off his crouch boxing, he punched his father right in the dick. this child is a monster, and i feel like from now on he should be slapped down the stairs all the time. also, i took the advice being given in the comments and tried to explain to his parents that he shouldn't be allowed to just punch people and they agreed to start punishing him more severely, but this little prick now fears me.","baby punched me in my crap filled bowels, accidentally slapped him down the stairs."
420,"a little background.  i have a 1967 gibson skylark, it's a small 5w tube amp.  last summer i restored it to working order by doing a full filter cap replacement and adding a 3-pronged ac cord, all without killing myself.  those 3 years of the electronics vo-tech program in high school sure have paid off.  i brought it to the studio recently to record it and during the trip the positive leg of the ac cord came detached inside the amp.

today i was bored and decided to crack it open and reattach the wire.  i got it open, removed the chassis, re-soldered the cord, plugged it in and tested it.  success!  time to close it up.  i slid the chassis back in place and i grabbed one of the 2 little bolts that hold it in place flat on the bottom.  there's not much clearance between the top of the amp and the bottom of the chassis so i put my hand in to screw the left side in (power section is on the left, caps and components are on the right).  

**zap!**

god i'm fucking dumb.  i got distracted by my roommate after i tested the amp and my dumb ass forgot to unplug it.  my right hand made contact with one of the wires and the ground and i felt electricity shoot straight up my arm.  i reacted pretty much instantly and got away but man, what a feeling.  i used to get shocked by my other big tube amp because i bought it without a ground pin, but that was more of a gradual awful buzzing feeling in my arms.  this was a straight up zap that made my arm numb for a minute.

after i stepped away i realized how the result could've been worse.  here i was with my hand inside a plugged-in high voltage tube amp with no shoes or gloves on.  had i been more careless and made contact with the filter caps and the ground or had both hands on the chassis when i got zapped i could've possibly gotten fucked up.  we don't have a circuit breaker in my apartment so i'm not sure if it would've just turned off.

i lost track of when the test was and about three weeks ago i found out that the test was rapidly approaching, so i bought an sat2 practice book to learn a years worth of information ive yet to learn. i havnt left my house for the past three weekends in all honesty; ive been too busy trying to learn all of this stuff for today.

the proctor says that the times up and im feeling amazing, i honestly felt like i may have gotten above a 700 out of 800 which is really good (at least in my opinion). the proctor then says to sign our names at the bottom below our answers where theres a line to do so. i dont see a line, so i pull her over and apparently i fucked up hard. i bubbled in all my answers on the back of the packet instead of the second page of the packet. this entire time, i was thinking that the answer sheet was a sheet, not a packet. it hurts to know i spent weeks studying hard for no reason.

 

edit: i may have very possibly not have fucked up as much as i thought. ive been told by a few people across the internet that what i did might not be that big of a deal at all, for me at least. sorry that i didnt fuck up today, ill try harder next time.","i thought a packet was a two sided sheet, so i got a 0 on a test i spent three weeks studying for"

427,"every day since the incident i have had urges to shit but when i sat down only one loud airy fart would come out.  no poop.  this got scarier as time passed.  but yesterday, i had that feeling where i needed to shit bad and i rushed to the bathroom.  i could finally feel something long and hard exiting my ass, i was so happy.  i made sure to get a good look at this thing, it was big.  it was probably about as thick/long as 3 well nourished turds.  it was like a brown can off redbull but twice as long.  there were also 2 standard logs on top of that.  we have this toilet at our apartment that you could flush a live house cat down if you wanted to, but it struggled with this batch of shit.  although this was a nice poop, it does not come close to my 2 favorite shits of all time: ""the flak cannon"" and ""the spaghetti and meatballs"".

i was glad to have finally shit, but i knew of course it was not over.  this morning i woke up and prepared for work then  i felt hella rumble in my stomach.  rushed to the bathroom asap, shot out a small round rocket ship then began peeing out of my ass with no end in sight.  i could not stop fucking shitting.  i had to call in at work i was shitting so motherfucking much.

anyways, i think it's all over now.  it was an interesting experience that i'm glad i had but i certainly will not be repeating any of this ever again if i can help it.","finally pooped, and pooped enough to miss work."
428,"i am in college and i decided to visit my dad because i hadn't seen him in a while. we decided to get pizza and beer. of course i got shitfaced because i don't drink all that much normally. so i decided to sit down at the table and chill for a while and there was an ikea catalog in a pile of junk mail. whilst flipping though it i found a page of coupons. there was a picture of a person with their mouth open so i did what any classy drunk person would do. i drew a dick in their mouth. of course one thing lead to another and there were cocks, tits, zombies and all sorts of horrific fuckery. the book had pages and pages of all kinds of weird shit. i put the book back like normal assuming my dad would find it later and laugh at it. he later told me that he gave it to the neighbor lady because he doesn't shop at ikea.","- got drunk and drew dicks in a book, gave neighbor lady a book of dicks."
429,"alright ladies and gents

t'was only a small fuck up but in the interests of honesty of the almighty counter i believe i should retell my story.

i got home from work and as per usual i hopped on reddit. today i had been slightly more gassy than usual but i thought nothing of it and went about my business. the urge to shit came up but i did the good ol squeeze technique to delay the inevitable and continued to scroll through the interwebs where i completely forgot that i needed to shit.

flash forward a few hours and i have eaten dinner and after walking half way back from the mess hall i suspected i had a sweaty ass crack so i pulled my undies up higher to attempt to alleviate my discomfort at which moment i discover it wasn't sweat but just shit that i had sitting in my ass from earlier but i was too stupid to realise. i headed straight back to my room, got undressed and showered so all in all it was only a minor fuck up but i still question how i got to being an adult and forgetting that i should go to the toilet when i need to.",shat myself and took an hour or so to realise it.
430,"the location : my kitchen and the head height cupboard that i keep my tea in. 


the tifu moment : opening the cupboard to help myself to a nice oolong i jostled the contents in my search. this jostling seemed to have no effect on the cupboard contents, but this was a trap. my attention taken by the thoughts of the upcoming cup of hot bliss, one of the jars saw its moment and leapt from the confines of the only world it knew. this maiden voyage would have ended in disaster for the jar, if not for my toe, which halted the plummet. 
my toe, after this impact, decided to send a rather large pain impulse through my nervous system. once i had finished scream crying, all thoughts of tea were gone. i flung the wayward jar back into its storage gulag and went to ice my toe. 

over the next two days, the pressure in my lower digit grew, turning the whole nail an inky shade of blue black that rivalled the night sky and even a draft blowing on it was painful. i ventured forth and visited a man of medicine. 

this venerable gentleman recommended that he release the pressure in the offending nail through a hole. 
i lay on the hard bed, eyes fixed on the ceiling, waiting for the anticipated prick of the blessed numbing needle before he works his way through the keratin. instead, i feel a stab as he cuts straight into the underside of the nail and then squeezes. stars scream across my vision before finally relief. the dull nausea inducing throb is gone, and i have bled all over the place. he informs me that he was going to numb my toe and drill, but since i had done such a good job on growing a lovely haematoma, it was easier to just make the incision immediately. 

my lesson learnt, i limp home, make a note to not visit such an old school practitioner of the medical sciences and carefully reorganise the tea cupboard.",tea jar fell on toe and caused subungual haematoma. doctor stabbed underside of nail to release pressure
431,"so i was in chemistry class today, and i was stoked because it was my first class as a senior! class of 2014, woo! i was all prettied up and dressed in my new school uniform, like in the animes. i was gonna make my last year of high school one to remember!

the teacher gave us a brief intro to the class, leaving us about ten minutes at the end to talk quietly amongst ourselves. none of my friends were in this class, so i just doodled in my notebook. then i felt a sneeze coming on.

the sneeze was silent. the aftermath was not.

you know how rooms will occasionally experience a sudden, unexplainable silence now and then? one hit ours... just in time for me to unleash the loudest, longest, bassiest toot of my life. i’m thinking a 7.7 on the richter scale. basically, i did a kamehameha from my butt. my chair was blown to pieces as the force lifted me off the ground. i struggled to hold my skirt down, like a gross marilyn monroe. i watched as the poor soul directly behind me had her very flesh ripped from her bones by the blast. in the end, all that was left of my classmates were their shadows.

i exaggerate, but really, that was a harrowing poot. it lasted about three seconds, but felt like a lifetime.

everybody was floored. it’s an all-girls school, so there isn’t really any public farting. i tried to feign innocence, but my luminescent blush betrayed me. i began to wonder if i could seppuku with my craft scissors. would they believe me if i said my shoe squeaked on the floor? maybe if it doesn’t sme- oh god it smells. my face felt so hot; i knew i was turning bright red.

my teacher crossed the room and turned on the vents they use to vent toxic fumes in case of a lab accident. the laughter was thunderous.",tried to make a good impression on my first day as a senior. i blew it.
432,"so let's just give a bit of background here, i, like a lot of people, watch porn. the thing is, i have this nice sharp 1080p so i'm not going to watch some crappy low quality video. instead, i am a member of a couple private torrent trackers for porn. this has resulted in me having quite a [big amount](http://imgur.com/pqqcsgg) of porn on my hard drive.

me and a friend are currently working on a big project, one which involves computers. now, my porn folder is hidden away quite well. the actual torrent files are not, since people looking around my computer folders is not a regular occurrence. so, i'm navigating to a file and mistakenly click on the folder with torrent files in it. though the upper half of the screen contained folders like music and movies, the lower half was filled with, well, pretty descriptive titles. 

it's important to note my friend's character. while most of my friends would laugh at such an incident, this friend is somewhat shy and i feel that such an incident could at least make our relationship somewhat weird. feeling my heart sink, i clicked away as quickly as humanly possible, hoping that he hadn't managed to read the titles. there was no reaction on his face either. 

skip to a couple hours later, i see something pop up in my lower right corner. up popped a ""finished download"" notification, telling me (us) that the download of [*pornstar name* *pornstar name* .... slut .... (i'm trying to not be too specific here). again, with my heart dropping at the speed of light, i clicked it away in the blink of an eye but the chances of him seeing at least something in either of these incidents are obviously pretty damn big.",showed shy friend massive porn collection. showed him again in case he didn't see it the first time.
433,"oh god. there are so many layers to this story. it all started because my boss refuses to accept that our website is relatively easy to navigate and instead insists on trying to search for whatever he's looking for each time he gets on it. but because it's a wordpress site, the default search function only searches ""posts"" and not the entire site. this is a known thing that drives people like me batty, but since most people don't search our site, i wasn't overly concerned.

apparently my boss was. so this resulted in a kind of nasty email to me last night asking if i could ""fix it"" like it was broken.

so this morning i did some research trying to 1) be a good employee and 2) not ever get that email again cause it made me want to hit things. i found a plugin that worked with our cart system (woocommerce) that should solve the problem. perfect! but some things will have to be updated first, including wordpress. so i backup our whole site first, like i'm supposed to i guess, install all my shit and...oh no.

when we built this website our designer created a custom theme and did kind of a hack job forcing the woocommerce code into it so now that woocommerce updated suddenly everything is awful. nothing works and half the page shows up as error code on every. single. product. 

okay. so this is bad. but i can fix it, right? i can restore from the backup i made before i updated! wrong. there's a duplicate line of code (or something i don't totally understand the error message) so myphpadmin won't accept the file. so basically i'm fucked. and now my boss has noticed it's broken and it's all he can talk about.

if i had just ignored his email or told him it couldn't be done i could have gone on my merry way and none of this would have happened and he probably would have forgotten it in a week. but i decided to try and be a good employee or something and now everything's broken.

 

**update:** the original site designer had a backup folder of an outdated version of the plugin on her computer that we were able to replace on the ftp. everything basically works again but i'm not touching anything for a while. so it's okay for now but i still wish i knew why it went so bad in the first place!",i tried to update my company's website built on wp and now everything is awful and if i had just let my boss obsess over what wasn't a problem for a few days until he forgot and just ignored him it would have been fine. tifu by taking initiative.
434,"so i got a awesome dugout which helps with my public smoking. i like to smoke omw to work, i take the bus. so while i'm walking down the street  maybe around 7:40ish am. bust out my dugout and take a nice long drag, hold it for a few, and blew it out in a glorious cloud. right into a passing runners face, he was running up the street behind me and due to my headphones in i never heard him coming. he never looked back, he never said a word.... he just kept running. through my coughing i yelled ""i'm so sorry"" but he never looked back.....",i blew pot smoke into a passing runner who never even acknowledged it
435,"so i'm in college right now but i'm off for the summer. i'd say my average bed time in college was around 1 or 2 but i've been going to bed around 11 most nights when i'm home. i love sleeping! and i'm not so much as a really late night person. 

well one of my best friends in the marines got one day off today to spend with his family so he's going to a family reunion today (he enlisted a little over a year ago and is now stationed off the coast of nc and has a chance of being deployed over seas in about six months or so). 

so he got back around 2 last night. no problem i wouldn't miss it so two other friends and i had decided to meet at ihop to catch up since he was leaving early this morning at 530. i'm super tired and get there first and notice its closed. so i tell them and we decide to just go to mcdonalds. at this point i'm getting a little fed up with just driving around past 2 in the morning. 

i've been driving for almost four years and haven't gotten in an accident or gotten a ticket before. i start backing up out of the parking spot to take off and all of a sudden smash something behind me. i never even thought to look in the rear view and ended up backing straight into one of those huge cement cylinders that hold light posts in place in parking lots. my bumper is now fucked and i've been pissed since last night bc of it. i barely have the money to pay for it right now, but my mom is making me since she doesn't want anybody driving around in my car when it looks broken. 

i know it was completely my fault and a careless mistake, but its still frustrating.",i was too tired to drive and ended up paying for it by fucking up my car.
436,"my boyfriend dislocated his knee over the weekend while he was out visiting me (we have a long-distance relationship). since his knee is mostly okay and we're not about to let some quality bang-time go to waste, we've been coming up with creative positions for sex so that he doesn't have to move his leg.

one of these positions entails me laying across his chest in a sort of upside down 69. he decided to use the vibrator today. he's getting me close to climax and, since he knows i squirt sometimes, he was getting prepared for a possible onslaught of epic cum-portions. i start to climax and instead of cum, i squirt piss out onto his chest as i orgasm. i run into the bathroom to clean up as he lays on the bed laughing his dick off.

437,"well, this happened a couple of weeks ago, but it's still a fuck-up.  we went to this restaurant with my dad, that serves the best salami pizza in the galaxy. i wolfed down the giant pizza like a starving t-rex, it was a nice meal, we had dessert, and after that, we left the restaurant, and i start to feel a little queasy. i think nothing of it, and just walk home. when i go to bed, i still have this odd feeling in my stomach, but i proceed to browse a little reddit, and then go to sleep. in the morning, i wake up to the feeling of my guts being roasted with the power of a thousand suns! ""holy fuck!"" i exclaim out loud, and run for the bathroom. as you might guess, i puked all my digestive fluids out with a half-digested pizza coming up my throat in big lumps. as if that wasn't enough, while i'm kneeling there, spewing pizza-infested matter from my mouth, my butt decides to go all-inferno-mode. soon enough, i start spewing said matter from my mouth, and my anus. after the poo-bombardment os over, i clean up the floor, and just go to bed.","ate too much pizza too fast, ended up spewing shit from my mouth and my butt."
438,"well here's how it went down, i decided to stop being lazy yesterday morning and give my dog a real long nice walk, so i get dressed in moderately nice clothing and set out, everything is fine, dog is doing dog stuff, i'm doing people stuff, yet then i begin to get annoyed by the zillion or so bugs that are bothering me, annoying flies and such. 

fortunately, i've had this problem before, and as a guy with long hair, i'm used to just shaking my head as it whips around and disperses the bugs. 

unfortunately, i walked into a thick of flies, and spasm'd out a bit with head, and while the bugs were sent flying, in my lack of vision during this process, i happened to trip over the cobblestone walk on my left and almost comically fell into a huge patch of dirt and mulch, slashing my legs on the cobble walk.

441,back story yesterday i didn't eat much . except what i did eat was pretty shitty through the day i had about six glazed donuts two sausage and cheese kolaches and a big plate of mashed potatoes for dinner. so today i was expecting a soft nasty shit. now to current events. so about 8 am everyday i take my daily dump. except this was one of those hits you all at once clench your ass and run to the restroom kinda shits. i work in a chemical plant and in the area i am at today there is a single restroom with a locked door. so i clench my ass and haul myself over to the crapper. well my shit started to slowly squeeze itself out with every step i am taking but i finally make it. i undress to take my shit and what's left of my underwear that's clean i cut up with my knife to get washed up and clean. well i hear the door open to the little building i am in taking a shit and figure whoever walked in will see the restroom door is closed and won't come in. nope! a minute later this old operator in his late 50s walks up and opens the door that i thought i locked while i'm in mid wipe. my cut up shit stained underwear sitting on the floor next to me . soooo there's my fucked up little story for the day.,i shit my self and an old man walked in on me mid wipe with shitty underwear on the floor next to me.
442,"i (a male) was walking across campus at my university past our big clock tower. i hear a girl yelling through a megaphone about her experience with date-rape, and i think ""uh oh, there's one of the feminists meetings here"". i only say uh-oh because this isn't the university sponsored feminist group, it's the one that's kind of infamous on our campus for being radical and violent. i'm very much for rights for women, but vandalism and blackmail just isn't how you should do it.

so i'm kind of zoned out walking past the clock tower to class. the megaphone is super loud and bouncing off all the walls and hedges so i can't tell where it is coming from. the megaphone girl was just getting to the part where all men suck: ""after my rape every male figure in my life disowned me, my dad, boyfriend, and all my guy friends. but it showed me that i don't need them in my lives"" and she's sobbing while telling this.  

right as i start to think ""man this is really heavy"" i decide to look up to see that i have walked straight into this meeting and am standing about 5 feet away from the girl with the megaphone. she has stopped talking and is staring at me along with roughly 50 girls (who i'm sure have the most awesome opinion of men at this point) giving me the death glare. this moment could only be made worse by my wardrobe choice that day. i was wearing a shirt i had ironically bought for parties a few days earlier that brandished a large and colorful ""party with sluts"" on the front. after standing still for what seemed like an eternity i quickly nope-ed the fuck out of there.",feminists probably want me dead
443,"i'm a college freshman and he's a senior in high school. i merely skimmed through his status and thought to myself that he was giving a send off to his class such as 'its been fun' or 'good luck to you guys in the future'. i commented, trying to bust his balls by saying 'let's see how you feel in college... ' 

some other person comments 'who's this douchebag?"" i think to myself ""lighten up, buddy"". but then i decided to reread the status. he was talking midway of how he had a close friend who passed away. the person who called me out was her boyfriend. 

i promptly deleted my comment and messaged my friend and the other person, explaining that i misread the status.",didn't read a status and typed a joke; insulted some dude's dead girlfriend
444,"today i had a sexual experience that is comparable to a video on efuckt. i have never felt the need to throw up from being so embarrassed.it's going to be pretty long, just a heads up.

i should give you the preface; i have always had a taste for odd foods. i'll look at a menu and see something such as monkey toes or bumble bee's urethra and my response 9 out of 10 times is ""hell yeah i want that weird ass shit"". today was no different. a random new hippy -dippy store appeared this week , i was curious so i ordered something from a white dirty man with a beard like mose called a ""power green house punch"" smoothie with some questionable ingredients. one sip and it felt like a mma crack head punched me in the stomach, i made a mistake.

fast forward a couple hours later, my stomach is feeling better and i'm on my way to see my boyfriend. we start discussing dota, which leads to the unavoidable sex. everything is going great, until i received a mega man stroke that made arch my back and release my bowels. at first i didn't realize that i not only shit myself but also shit on boyfriend. then the smell hit me and all i could think was ""damn you hippies!"" 

at this point i'm trying to play it cool, with the hopes that maybe he doesn't know that i shit myself from his power fucking. to try and distract him from the poop running down my ass i start putting in double time, pulling out every move in the book. my thought process was that maybe the smell of good sex will overpower the smell of shit. nope, wrong, so very wrong. the room smelt like two homeless people fucking with cat shit as lube, and to make things worse with every thrush, my boyfriend is being cover with more shit. 

i finally give up on trying to make it less awkward but i'm still in full panic mode and looking for a way to make this sticky situation into a better one.  for some reason, i though that giving him head would make him would make him feel better because at least he got off. yeah, because sucking a dirty poop dick is sexy. my plan didn't work, the moment i put it in my mouth the smell and taste hit me and i was like a deer caught in headlights, expect instead of lights it was a dick that smells like shit in my mouth. i sat motionless with his dick in mouth for a few seconds. then i apologized and left faster than a  fat guy chasing a wheel of cheese down a hill.


looking back on all of this makes me cringe, i’m never leaving my bed  or eating from a dude name “moon dance” again.



 




 
edit: hey everyone, i'll clear up a few things and have a few things that i need to add to my ongoing increasingly awkward story. i'm glad my misfortune could make you guys laugh, hopefully if you are ever on my situation you do the complete opposite of what i did. 

first, i'm a girl. no doubt about that. second, my boyfriend noticed for sure. it was the middle of the day with the sun jammin outside ,we were also doing it ""doggy"" style. probably the worst position if you shit yourself. he just is a trooper and didn't want to make it more awkward.

after i left i went home and sat in my bed reconsidering my life choices and cringing as the smell of poop and sex still clung to my skin. then i realized, i done fucked up i left all shit at his house. i considered just leaving it there and moving to the the furthest country away. i thought about it for a while until i came up with a brilliant idea. maybe if i just pretend it didn't happen he'd think that maybe it dint happen. plus its no big deal, i'm a grown ass woman sometimes adults shit themselves and it gets on other people, no shame in that. 


eventually after practicing my lines, i worked up the courage to go to his house. i get there and no answer, so i do what anyone who wants to avoid the person you shit on. i sly cooper my ass into his room. i go into his room and fuck, the smell of shit ton of freezebrezze that mixed with shit and sex making the room smell like a tropical std . as  i started trying to get all my stuff i saw his dog, licking the bed, i went over to see if i got help him thinking maybe his toy was under the blanket. sure enough, he was licking a shit stain that was on the bed. fuck me. 

on my way out , my boyfriend comes out of the bathroom.  like i said before i'm terrible at handleing stress so i start speed walking like its 1999 in hopes that he won't see me. of course he does, so in my panic i proceed to ask him ""how was the sex?!"" . he must think i'm violently sick because all he did was ask me how i'm feeling. i just left without saying anything. if i ever see him again ill update you.  

p.s i went to the hippies to see why it made me shit and he informed me that ""its a totally detox for your mind and body"". only thing that got detox is my butthole. fuck you hippie and you delicious drinks.



tldr: i went back to his house to find his dog licking the shit and then tried to act like nothing happen.","i trusted a hippie, which lead to me having shitty sex and a room that smelt like a homeless hooker shelter. i then try to suck the poop off his dick in order to make him cum. i don't make good decisions under stress."
445,so today i was bored and just laying around and browsing on my phone. then i randomly find one of my airaoft bb's on my bed and while i'm laying there on my phone just start to mess around with it in my hand. then i put it by my ear and set it in the little gap part. then as i go to take it put my finger knocks it in and it falls down into my ear canal. i then proceed to try and take it out but it's already lodged in. so now i'm on my way to the emergency room after trying everything i could to try and get it out so there's my f*ck up for today.,messing around with an aairsoft bb and it fell in my ear and now i'm going to the emergency room haha.
446,"i'll preface this by saying that i have not been very well the last few days. i had what was probably food poisoning last week and have been sickly since. i have eaten very little the last few days and i'm constantly trying to balance out hunger and nausea. 

this morning i woke up very hungry and only a little bit nauseous so i decided to make myself some breakfast. i have english muffins, egg, cheese, and baloney, so i thought i'd make myself a breakfast sandwich. i turned on the heat, set a pan and while it was waiting to heat i grabbed a used stick of butter. as i began to unwrap it i got an odd sense of almost dejavu – this stick of butter looks like something i've seen before. not sure what, butter doesn't look like many things... that's when it hit me. semen. i was standing in front of the heating pan, when i realized what i was thinking about was semen. it doesn't really make sense, i don't think semen ordinarily looks like a hard stick of butter. 

i became instantly nauseous anyway and puked onto the hot pan. i ran to the restroom to finish barfing only to barf harder when i began to smell frying vomit. in my rush i didn't turn off the stove! i went back to the kitchen to turn it off and proceeded to barf onto my hands, more into the pan, and finally into the sink. what followed was what i can only describe as barf-cleaning. i intermittently barfed while i tried to clean the pan only to barf on it again as i tried to chip away the barf bits. the pan's finally clean, but i'm not sure i ever want to use it again.",accidentally made barf omelet.
447,"this actually happened to me last night but i thought it was worth posting here now. so last night i went to a friends house after being invited for a party. i thought it would be just a few people... i was wrong there were so many people there and most of them i'd never meet

so i took my jacket off and left my wallet filled with $120 inside of it. i then put my jacket in the corner of the room by a couch. i noticed some of my friends were putting their stuff their. hours go by and i think nothing of it. until i look over and see my drivers license in the ground. i go and pick it up only to see my wallet sitting on top of my jacket which had been thrown on the ground. i quick grab it knowing what was inside. sure enough all my money is missing. i tried to ask around to my friends and people i've never met but too many people were coming and going i couldn't figure it out. so now i'm sitting here thinking about how i'm going to pay my speeding ticket that i got last week seeing as that was the money i was going to use. my life lesson out of this. you should keep you personal items on you at all times.",- lost 120 dollars that i needed to pay a ticket. i hate people.
448,"so i thought it would be a good idea to take my brother-in-law out to a party that was filled with some of my really close friends. he works a lot and doesn't get out even on his one day off a week. so i told him to have a good time and i would be the dd. well he hasn't drank a lot in awhile and kinda went over bored. mixed his liquors with a couple of beers as well as a couple of ciders. he gave himself alcohol poisoning. so after i thought he was done throwing up, i walked to get the car. i drove the car closer so he could just climb in and i would take him home. turns out he still needed to puke some and while doing that he also released some from the other end. im texting him what is taking him so long, asking if he needed help getting to the car? he says no he can make it but he had an accident in his pants. i have to think quickly on how to take care of this without causing a scene at the party and drawing attention. i remember i have some old clothes in my trunk that are too small for me so they would not fit him. i use them as a liner for the back seat and put the plastic bag on top of the clothes to create another barrier. he gets in the backseat and i can smell his puke and fecal matter. i book it to his place made it in 15 mins when its suppose to take 30. dropped him off and threw away the bag and all the clothes underneath him. but now im stuck with this knowledge and nobody else knows and i don't know how im ever going to look at him the same way again.",my brother-in-law shit himself after getting alcohol poisoning and i had to drive him home still.
449,"alright, so i always laugh at the stories on here where people shit themselves and think ""no fucking way i'd ever do that..."" i'm now eating my words. really just typing this up to relieve some of the stress that i've accumulated over the past few hours.

it always happens when it really shouldn't right? here's some context. myself and my parents sit down in the family room to watch a soccer game around 5:45 this afternoon. as halftime approaches we hear a loud dripping. we assume someone left the faucet on; not so. we go to the entryway of the house and there is an obscene amount of water dripping through a seam and a lightbulb socket in the ceiling and onto the floor. we immediately surmise that the hot water heater (which is, of course, on the top floor) has sprung a leak. we spend about an hour cleaning up the mess on the two floors, then my father calls our insurance company to get someone out and assess and fix the water damage and the water heater, and in the meantime we sit down to watch the end of the game.

the game ends, and my dog is a bit stressed from all the commotion so i decide to take him for a nice long walk. normally i use the bathroom before a long walk but i literally felt nothing so i just ventured off into the wild unknown.

bad idea. about halfway down my street i realize my bowels have decided to yell ""fuck you and everything you stand for"" and i immediately turn around. i run back with my dog (in retrospect i may have been able to hold  it in more effectively had i walked, but i felt it *bad*.)

i get to my porch and then suddenly jt just lets loose. i assure you it wasn't a pleasant firm log either, but a chunky, barely held together pile. i sprint into the bathroom, but the damage is done (although not nearly finished). i take off my shorts, meanwhile dropping my phone into the (currently clean) toilet for icing on the cake that was this shit evening.

now, anyone who has shit themselves so forcefully knows that rationality exits almost simultaneously with your excrement. so it was that i found myself flushing a toilet that was filled with toilet paper and lumps of shit. what do you know, it overflows. being a panicked and irrational teenager i scream for help, wrapping a towel around myself, and my wonderful father runs in and shuts off the water valve. unfortunately it was too little too late, and the bathroom's tiles are covered in shit water and specks of toilet paper. to top it off i have shit on the side of my leg and on my shoes and my boxers are destroyed.

somewhere in this commotion the two guys arrive to assess and fix the damage. by this point we've shut down gas, (obviously) hot water, and electricity in the affected rooms. i won't go into the cleaning process of cleaning the bathroom floor and unclogging the toilet. then, i have to take a freezing cold shower with no water pressure to clean myself off.

rather comical situation, i guess. i might have left out some details, but essentially the overflow in the bathroom leaked into the basement so we now have dehumidifiers running in four rooms of the house and there's just about no way i'm getting any sleep tonight. i can't tell if my timing was perfect because we had the guys (for whom i now have some immense respect for not even batting an eye) coming around anyway, or terrible because i then had just about no way to clean myself off.",shitting yourself--it could happen to *you*
450,"cooked [vegetarian korma](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/vegetarian-korma/detail.aspx) for dinner. i liked it. much less spicy than i expected, but that's fine because i don't care for that kind of heat.

some time after dinner, i touched my dick, and the little amount of capsaicin from the jalapeño transferred over and began irritating the foreskin. this was very uncomfortable.

over the course of a few minutes, i tried using saliva and milk to remedy it to no avail (i've heard that milk has some enzyme or something, but never really looked into it). i then consulted [wikipedia's suggested treatment options for capsaicin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capsaicin#treatment_after_exposure) and accordingly spent several more minutes applying vaseline. since this was mostly unsuccessful, and since i still had quite a bit of pain, after much delaying i stuck my dick in a cup of canola oil. it worked.","got spiciness on my dick, removed it by putting dick in canola oil"

then, a computer broke. 

not because we were clicking too much, or the computer overheated, but because in my excitement over my roommate's golden cookie powerup i knocked over a glass of water onto his new macbook pro. and despite our valiant efforts, doing all the things one should do when mixing water and electronics, the computer is now in the shop for what i assume is at least a new logic board.","cookie clicker may be free for most, but it cost me $800."
452,"this actually happened maybe a month ago.

i had a whole package of those extra-long necklace glowsticks on the floor in my bedroom. i stepped on the package by accident and cracked all of them.

i figured, ""well, why waste them?"" so i finished cracking them, shook them all up, and looped them together. then i turned off the light . . . to find my entire room was speckled green.

one of the green ones had cracked open. so i figured, ""hell, might as well wander down to the kitchen and get my glow on in a glass!""

i went to the sink, put a glass in it, cut one end of the glowstick and inverted it. then i tried to cut the top off, too. somehow the scissors bent it and when the top came off it flung glowing liquid everywhere, speckling the kitchen and dowsing my eyes.

i normally leave all the lights off but it hardly mattered as i stupidly rushed blind to the bathroom instead of trying to rinse it in the sink.

admittedly, the five seconds of glowvision were pretty sweet. not to mention that moment between looking in the bathroom mirror and pulling the chain for the light.

long story short, i washed my eyes out and was fine. the chemicals weren't corrosive or anything but it burned like crazy.",i accidentally broke a glowstick and flung the liquid into my eyes.
453,"i've been writing a powershell script to find and delete redundant $recycle.bin files in our thousands of user personal folders.  

the script is going well. it works perfectly fine. it takes a matter of minutes and gives beautiful log and error output info.  

then i notice that i'm not using the same standardised variable name for the folder i'm trying to clear out, so i edit one of my functions to bring it into line. great, now the function should use the right variable name.  

i run the script and check my error logs. instead of the 78 kb file i'm expecting (from previous runs it was that size), i get a 4.9 mb file. shit.  

i check the file and see that it's got errors like ""unable to delete c:\windows. folder not empty"". fuck.  

i check other folders on the server and notice they're also empty. hardly any files to be found. it's like a digital ghost town.
i check my code again and see that i forgot to change the variable on the line that does the actual deleting:  

    ...
    remove-item $folder\* -recurse -force -erroraction silentlycontinue
    ...

the function accepted param([string] $path), not $folder.
instead of powershell going ""hey, i see a bug here. something's wrong, so i'll stop"", it goes straight ahead and does a recursive delete from the root of the c: drive. anything my script was able to delete, it did.  

i immediately owned up to the problem and got our servers and storage manager to see what he could do.  

there was no server image to restore from. the backup software on the server wasn't working because.. i'd deleted it. he first had to install the backup software before attempting to do a restore. the restore is still running. the server will be rebooted tomorrow, and if it's fine it'll be left as-is. if not it'll need to be re-done from scratch.  

no biggie, the server wasn't doing much apart from being required for governmental security compliance..  

 

**update: it's all fine.** the restore on c:\\* worked. the server's license had to be re-entered. i guess i removed *some* files that made it think it wasn't the genuine article. it's been rebooted and seems healthy again. i've read all and replied to some comments. thankyou to those of you saying that you've fucked up on mega scales before. it makes mine seem like it's [just a flesh wound](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/012/877/3qafhk.jpg). :)",all it took was a sphinctosecond to recursively delete everything i could on the c: drive of a local government security logging server.
454,"here's word for word what i sent to my friends after it happened:

me: 
so...i just pissed myself in my sleep on the couch but i have a really good reason as to why i did it and before you ask, no i'm not drunk or anything i was just under a lot of pressure in my dream.

dream world: loki is suing the police because a cop urinated on him and broke his arm. yes my cat 

since he was suing the police and he's such a celeb there has been a lot of media attention surround the case. i constantly have reporters in my face asking me questions about his arm, his state of mind, what i thought of the case, etc etc. 

oh p.s. i fell asleep listening to law and order svu so i'm sure most of this dream is directly related to that.

so anyways i go to take a piss into my toilet/loki's food bowl because this is dream world and loki lives in a toilet.

as i start taking a piss loki begins batting my piss with his broken arm and i'm like ""wtf you little liar!"" so i'm thinking yea i'll hurry up and finish pissing and i'll call the news station to show them my cat is an asshole.

so i hurry up and begin to push and i could feel the squeezing of my kidneys irl but whatever i continue to pee in this very odd toilet. now the toilet is a square and in the middle is loki's food and then there are 2 little boxes that must be 2 inches by 2 inches so to pee in them is stupid but this is how all toilets are for cat owners #duh

so i continue to pee and loki is batting at it and getting it all over the floor and i'm getting pissed (not a pun) so i shove my dick into one of these 2 boxes but 2 things are wrong here.

1. i have morning wood so my piss is spraying out the side

2. i'm peeing so hard that my piss is penetrating the walls of this toilet, which was weird because i knew this was indeed possible to do but i didn't think i was pushing that hard.

so i figure ah fuck it i'll clean up the mess later i need to hurry up and finish.
but the small box i'm peeing in is starting to fill up and the last thing i want is to piss on my own dick so i pull out and fall off the couch

the real fucking couch!

i'm confused and wondering how i ended up on the floor but the warm sensation on my left thigh politely told me i fucked up.

i inspect the couch to find it was dry...except between the cushions...

remember that box i told you i shoved my dick in to make it easier to piss... it was actually the couch cushions! i piss fucked my couch cushions! what the actual fuck!?

so realizing it was all a dream i was both horrified and relieved because i didn't have to pee in that weird toilet but i totally pissed this couch.

now i'm showered and i need to go to work in a few hours so i'm going to bed. i'll deal with it tomorrow lmfao! good night.

chris (friend):
you're a fucking clown!

tom (brother):
who the fuck has a wet dream about their cat and piss!?

mike (friend):
i’m crying right now! how did this happen?

chris:
laughing as hard as i did is worth waking up at 5am to get this random fucking message

tom: 
bro you’re a fucking adult wtf!?

mike:
piss fucked the couch! 

chris:
are you going to tell lindsey?

me:
fuck no! she’ll never let me forget it. for the rest of my life she’ll ask me “did you pee” before i attempt to go to bed…oh god it’s like being ten all over again….

chris:
lmfao i gotta tell your mom! 

me:
i will fuck you up kid.

eventually lindsey saw the texts and laughed at me for several days and she is the reason why i'm posting this on here today because she thought all of you would get a kick out of it. i hope you enjoyed my fuck up =(

edit: spelling","(yes i'm putting it first): i, a 24yr old man, pissed (in) my couch because in the dream i was having i thought i was getting 1 over on my cat. then of course i texted the scenario to my brother and 2 best friends."

456,"these two fuck ups are both somewhat related. explanation: i teach tennis, and i take ice in the mornings to put in the cooler so kids have cold water to drink throughout the day.

here's me being smart, thinking i can save a bit of money by buying ice in 20lb bags and sticking in a freezer we keep in the garage mostly for meat, steak, fajita meat, chicken, etc. so, the cooler at my workplace really only needs 10lbs, so i portion out 10lbs of the ice and then take that to work. unbeknownst to me, the ice rolled off of something and knocked the door to the freezer slightly ajar. fast forward 24 hours: to this morning. i go out to the garage to get some ice, bigass puddle of water on the ground, easily 5ft in diameter, shit. go let mom and dad know, turns out most of the meat will be thrown away (some steak didn't get thawed at all so that's what's for dinner tonight, fuckyeah.jpg). i get to work after buying some ice at a grocery store, and i am hitting tennis balls up into the air for kids to hit like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=8iclnhoaq9s&t=11), and the result is a fairly powerful shot. i hit this ball a little shorter than intended which allowed him to absolutely crush the ball. i imagine this kid managed to hit the ball at about 75 mph which is fairly fast for a non-professional player. the ball hit off the ground, ricochets off of the basket containing the tennis balls and right into my tip, left, and right nut (the ball got all three). ow.","ice knocks freezer open, thaws about $150 worth of steak & chicken, later on get hit in the nuts by a tennis ball flying at about 70mph."
457,"so this was actually about a week ago, i just got lazy and ddnt post immediately.

 so my girlfriend was hitting my bong. its about two feet so i usually torch it for her and pull the bowl because she cant see when its burnt all the way.

well this time i put just a wee bit too much bud in the bowl because she gave me the signal to pull it before it was done burning. so i pull it and i put my mouth above the bowl and suck the smoke up. ive done this hundreds of times before but this time i had to sneeze so i ended up opening my mouth more than it should have been and inhaling harder than i should have. 

i ended up sucking up the still burning cherry of the bowl and it went straight down my throat burning the shit out of everything it touched(i never felt it touch my mouth, it went straight to my throat). so i start coughing like crazy and run to the sink to spit it out. so im hacking up black shit at first(ash), then my spit turns white and bubbly(nothing wrong there), and then it starts to have a pinkish tinge to it. i kept coughing for about half an hour after this point, coughing up blood and pink shit the entire time. after about half hour, no more blood came up.",accidentally inhaled a burning cherry from a bong and coughed up blood
458,"i got a droid razr m with verizon a couple months ago with a new phone number. a few days ago, i was contacted by the woman that used to have my new phone number. she left me a voicemail stating that she turned on her ipad for the first time in 5 months, and it loaded all the text messages i sent and received from my new number. she replied to my contacts, asking ""who is this?"", which confused all of my friends and family because it showed up as my name/number. my full name also loaded on her ipad.

she hooked me up with the first screen shots, the last one is from my future husband who i accidentally texted after forgetting she could read all my messages.

at first, i thought it was verizon’s bad… but after they “investigated,” they were not at fault. i then contacted apple, where i immediately got transferred up to a tier 2 executive (this is big time, folks). his name is charles a.k.a “chaales.” at first he was very nice to me, and was like “omg this has never happened before!!” i thought to myself, “liars… i bet they just shennaniganed their way out of getting in trouble if this had happened before” (foreshadowing…cough cough). he filed an “urgent” report with top-level apple executives and probably consulted steve jobs via clairvoyant. after the 5-10 minute consultation with jobs, chaales called me back and proclaimed in an inspector gadget-esqe fashion, “wowsers! this was a toughie, but we got to the bottom of this.” after chaales told me how they were going to solve “my problem.” i told them thank you, and i mentioned i was contacting my lawyer because apple totally boned my privacy. chaales immediately put me on hold, and had to consult his boss. he got back on and said if i was contacting a lawyer, apple could no longer “help me” in this issue.

good work, apple. ;)","damn you, ghost of steve jobs!"
459,"so i was fully naked jerking it to some good old internet porn. it's been a few days since i last had a date with jill and i felt like going for as long as i could. i was edging, getting near the point of cumming, for quite a while now and was near busting. anyways, i hear the door to the apartment open, a roommate is home early. well, shit, my underwear are on the other side of the room after a passionate throw for the the excitement of making some baby batter. anyways, i get up to put them on, but just at that moment, i went over the edge. scrambling for my underwear, i start cumming everywhere; my legs, the carpet, my hands, and for a good 5 seconds after putting on my underwear. i quickly throw on my shorts to cover my now cum stained underwear just in time. my roommate, hopefully suspected nothing and i went on my merry way of taking a shower and cleaning up my carpet.","close to cumming while jerking it, roommate comes home early, cum everywhere after a single slip of the hand."

 i couldn't sleep last night (at a time that was technically today) so i decided to watch this movie, i watched the first one and personally i thought it was nothing, maybe one or two cringe-worthy scenes but i've seen worse, so i decided to watch the second one. i saw that it was black and white, i thought it would make it less effective, after watching it i'm glad it was. it was the single most fucked up movie i've ever seen. though at times i felt bad for the man that did the ""surgery"" (if you could call it that), as he was mentally disabled and no one loved him, not even his own mother who tried to murder him at one point. but there was one funny scene where b from the first movie (the human centipede was a movie within a movie here) was talking like the first movie was a block buster a-list success. i'm not even going to say the most fucked up scene unless asked. though i did fall asleep soon after finishing it, though i don't know if it's because i have a high tolerance for horror/gore, or because i took a sleeping pill before watching it

it was a typical spring day, and i was in middle school, sitting in class and talking to a friend. i don't remember the details, but he told me a joke that i found extremely funny. for some odd reason, i responded to his joke by laughing hysterically and ended up whipping my head in a downward motion towards the desk where a mesh binder was placed. i had braces at the time, so they somehow ended up getting caught in some of the lacing of the mesh binder. the binder was something like this : http://cheapbinderstores.blogspot.com/2013/05/case-it-velcro-closure-2inch-ring-binder.html

464,"okay, this actually happened last month but i only found out about this subreddit today.

i went over to my friends house to stay the night. for about half a week prior to the night, i had been having stomach cramps. **bad** cramps. the next morning, i farted and the fart woke me. it wasn't a regular everyday fart, but a shart. luckily, i always sleep on my stomach so there were no stains. i rolled off the top bunk (real men always call top bunk) as quietly as possible as i didn't want to wake my friend who is a heavy sleeper, ran as fast as i could towards the bathroom which was right across the hall, but before i could make it, i ran into my friends mother. she saw that i was hurrying to the toilet so she said ""go."" i ran in front of her, creating a trail of shit scent for her to walk straight into. i go into the bathroom and lock myself in for what seemed like a century. luckily, she had to go to work that day. about an hour went by before she left and i was still on the toilet. i wiped, flushed and ran straight to the shower, washed my pants which were beach shorts so they dried really quickly. chilled for about an hour before i left.","shat pants, friends mother smelt what i dealt, gives me a funny look whenever she sees me, which is quite often."
465,"yes, soup.  

my first error was misjudging the amount of water i needed to use.  i’d never made this kind of soup before.  i don’t do a whole lot of cooking.  so, put the ingredients in the pot.  in go the pieces of cut up carrot, and the cut up onion, the chicken legs.  all in the pot.  with too much water.

the second error was not following my mothers specific advice of tasting as i went.  i just put it all in the pot, brought it to the boil, and then reduced to a simmer. left it for about an hour.  when i came back to it, it smelt pretty good.  had i tasted it, i would have realised that something had gone wrong, and instead of delicious chicken soup, i had slightly chickeny water.  i cooked up some noodles and put them and the chicken water in to the bowl.
it wasn’t until i sat down to eat that i realised that things had not gone according to plan.  i was pretty hungry, so i ate the bowl of noodles, the chicken bits were ok, but the broth was not the best.  i figured that i could remove some of the water from the pot, and let it simmer.  let the excess water cook off without hopefully losing too much flavour.  so i turn the stove back on, and go back into the living room to wait.

which brings us to my third error.  falling asleep.  i dozed off on the couch, and woke up later to a funny smell.  it smelt really odd. i couldn’t quite place it.  then i realised what was happening and sat up with a start.  i rushed to the kitchen and flung the door open, to be greeted by floor to ceiling smoke.  thick white smoke.  it reminded me of being in the bathroom when it gets filled up with steam.  the smell was awful.  i turned the stove off and opened the window.  the exhaust fan was already on, but was ineffectual.  i grabbed a tea towel, and used it to move the soup pot over to the sink, filling it half way with water.  

this seemed to stop new smoke from forming.  i rushed out of the kitchen and ran into the other room to get some air.  it was impossible to breathe in the kitchen.  the living room wasn’t much better. as soon as i’d opened the kitchen door, the smoke had started pouring out. i kept going toward the back of my apartment; the room furthest from the kitchen was the bathroom.  since it’s cold out, and i’d had the heater on, all three rooms had closed doors, so the bathroom air was relatively untouched.

once i’d got my breath, i left the bathroom closing the door behind me.  back in the kitchen, it was still pretty bad.  i waved a tea towel at the window in a fanning motion to try and clear the air.  i had to keep going back and forth from kitchen to bathroom to get air.  i kept going back and forth for a bit, but it wasn’t making much difference.  i had opened up all the windows in the apartment, but left the bedroom door shut throughout the whole event, with the hope that it would be preserved from the smoke.  i didn’t want to open the front door as it leads into the communal stairwell which is closed in.  as it was pretty late at night, i didn’t want to panic or smoke out my neighbours.  after an hour or so, i’d done as much as i could do.  i went to sleep that night hungry, with the smell of smoke in my nostrils.  

this all happened on sunday.  only today has the place really started to smell normal.  i’ve used fabreeze on the carpets in the living room, and burned a fair bit of incense. the kitchen still smells pretty smoky.  i had done laundry on the day i tried to cook the soup, and had several shirts hanging in the living room by the heater drying.  so i’ve had smoke scented shirts at work for part of the week.  the pot didn’t make it. i tried to clean it, but got the impression that it would never be clean again.  i threw it out tonight after trying to clean it again.  
i think i got some kind of closure throwing that pot away.  it was almost cathartic like writing this out. i feel like i can move on with my life now.",: don’t fall asleep if you have stuff on the stove.
466,"this one's long, sorry.  

some background, i just graduated from college. i've had a best friend for about 3 years (let's call him andy). andy and i have had crazy sexual tension since day one but we had never acted on it. andy has a roommate, ben, an extremely good looking soccer player. 

since andy and i are friends and ben is generally a homebody, the three of us ended up spending a lot of time together in their apartment the two years that they lived there, watching tv on their plushy 3-person couch. 

story time!

one saturday night in february, i drop by andy's to pregame. when i get there andy's being super lame and insists that he is too sick to go out. while i'm trying to guilt andy into going, ben mentions that he is feeling kind of ancy and so with some gentle coaxing ben and i end up going out without andy. 

while we're out i notice that ben is hitting on me and i'm like ""hell yes, getting on that"" (did i mention ben is really hot?) and we end up going back to his place to do it on the couch. ben and i hooked up a few times that month, always on his couch, before our attraction naturally fizzled out and we resumed just being friendly. one of the last times we hooked up i was wearing my lucky panties (they have shrooms printed on them). as i was getting dressed to leave afterwards, ben began straightening the couch cushions and pulled the panties out from between them and handed them to me, ""don't forget your shroom panties!"". i wore them and left. andy never knew ben and i were hooking up. 

fast forward two months, andy and i, in the heat of graduation frenzy, start fucking like rabbits. we fucked everywhere, my place, his place, bar bathrooms, you name it. this went on for about two weeks and then stopped. ben didn't know.

fast forward some more to a couple days ago, ben and andy are moving out! i offer to help pack so i stop by. ben steps out of the room for a minute, i'm working on taking down some posters and andy begins to remove the sofa cushions and finds my panties wedged into the side. 

andy: yo i found your panties!

me: what?

andy: your shroom panties. i guess you left them here when we were hooking up some time

me: oh shit i was looking for these!

ben walks into the room as andy is throwing the panties to me.

ben: are those your panties? i thought i gave those back to you. 

andy: you found these already? why'd you put them back in the couch?

ben: i didn't! she put them on and she left...unless i was way drunker than i thought i was

andy: wait what?

awkward. i feign confusion, but there's no hiding it now. as we talk, it is soon clear to both guys that i was sleeping with both of them, on the same couch, often while the other was asleep in the next room. i quickly excused myself and i haven't talked to either of the guys since. 

at least i have my lucky panties back right?","my lucky panties failed me, but they also got me laid, so i'm having trouble assessing my feelings towards them right now."

so several years ago, i got guitar hero 4 world tour for pc because i don't own any consoles. when playing it, i found that the fret keys are mapped to ""zxcvb"" and strum is the ""up arrow"". after playing it for a while i begin to think ""man, this sucks i want to play as if it was like guitar hero"", so i remapped the keys so that the frets are now the first 5 fn keys (f1, f2, f3, f4, f5) and strum is pause/break and therefore can play like [frets on fire](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/frets_on_fire_man.png).

i ended up getting pretty good at it, could play hard/expert songs with 90%+ accuracy. so this is where the fuck up happened… fast forward a bit forward, a lady friend at my school had a birthday party and invited us all to go bowling. after bowling we went to the arcade and what caught my eye was ""ohhhh sheeeeeiiiit they have guitar hero"". of course never played with a real guitar hero controller, my curiosity got the best of me.

so before i started playing, my lady friend came over and asked if she could join. ""of course you can"", i replied. so being the gentleman i am, i let her chose the mode and song. she chose ""vs mode"" and set her difficulty level to easy, since she never played. being the badass (i though i was), i chose hard. now bear in mind... my super awesome guitar shredding skills were on the keyboard. i ended up getting my ass kicked and booed off by the game.","tried to impress a lady friend on guitar hero at a birthday, but ended up failing miserably."
468,"so i thought i share this story with you, because *sharing is caring* and it amused so much people over the time and i thought maybe some of you might be amused too.

and yeah, if you thought it's not a real tifu, more likely a **""some years ago ifu""**...  
  
  
before starting the real story, here is some context:
    
**me** - [alpha as fuark](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3h-b7afnpe4/tqhdidpg0ki/aaaaaaaakju/qipbmwzysn4/s400/boss.gif); lazy as fuark; not the class clown but the guy who can't stfu  
**the one teacher** - [chubby](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view7/2765165/chubby-cuby-cake-boy-o.gif); young (below 30); tried to hit back on me, so often we entertained the whole classroom  
**school** - my last year, half a year before getting school leaving certificate/a level/higher school certificate (*get the term you understand*), traditionally students of the last year organize a prom to get some money...

at the beginning i have to tell you i wanted to **take revenge on him**, because at the previous exam this the teacher let me stand up and  beginning a police check because everybody knew i was cheating on every test, so he examined my desk and me but without success  
(and no, not a police control like in america with [pepper spray](http://www.dotgif.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/pepperspray.gif), tazer and other violent crazy shit)

so prom night was on, all students, teachers and families of students was there (families leave earlier, so they don't see their children drinking, **but regretfully my family left not early enough!**)  
i start my [heavy drinking and partying](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8p6h65wks1qmiff2o1_500.gif) like there is no tomorrow.
unfortunately there was a tomorrow and my memory was nearly erased, some dark memories were still there, but if you ever were drunk like a fish, you will know that you never want to know what you did...

after i woke up and turn on the tv, decided to spend the whole day in bed and didn't even thinking on using facebook, my sister decided to come in and ask **""soooo... do you even know what you did yesterday?""**, ""i've done quite a lot, but i'm pretty sure you will tell me something i don't know"" i answered. my stomach was turning like a fan, don't know if it's because of the hangover or thanks to the story i was about to hear. my mum and dad already joined my sister, **because three storytellers are better than one** i think.

so they told me **i was hammered quicker than usain bolt runs** (yep, shouldn't have drunken a bottle captain morgan alone while all the others were listening to the a speech of our principal, maybe my mistake). moved around with my mates, i met my family tried to speak to them, but [not really capable of speaking in my condition](http://i1046.photobucket.com/albums/b462/jessicaroseish/gif%20-%20no%20tumblr/luke-drunk.gif).  
so as fate willed the teacher was coming to us, saw me pretty drunk with my family around me, thinking i will not talk big. so yeah alcohol is a bitch. so i was mumbling around some things no one understanded and tried to be funny, but failed. so apparently i changed my tactics. i approached his wife beneath him and said **""soooooo... yooouuu are his wifeeeeey?!?!?!""** with a [drunken look of expectancy](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/oh-goodie.gif). at this point somebody should have stopped me, because everybody knew, this won't end well (but even i wouldn't prevent me, i'm just too funny). she responded with a confident ""yes"". i handed her my hand for a handshake (what a shit funny sentence), and before she touches it i said loud and clearly: ***""my deepest condolences!""*** ...[oooooooohhhhhh!](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/supa-hot-fire.gif)

[oh my fukin'](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/oh-boy.gif) ... [did i really](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bites-fist.gif)... [what the f](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/friday-damn.gif)... **but i think revenge was taken.** i was told [my mates were laughing their ass off](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/spongebobmoviehillbillylol.gif), rolling on the floor, tears running them down... the wife withdrawed her hand so fast, she might have **break the sonic barrier**, people said. my family was so embarressed of my behaviour they turned around and left the place.

so i was laying in my bed, a slight giggle came from me before i realized he is one of the teachers which have to grade me and [decides if i succeed or fail](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wuhwhat.gif) in graduating... yep i was pretty fucked up...

the first days of school after the prom i decided to be ""ill"", just to skip the gossip chats about the prom...  
at my first real day at school after prom i was welcomed by many people i didn't even know,  
legends have been told about me, the shiny knight who bravely fought against the dragon(, or a snorlax, depends on the view)  
and will be fallen in 6 months during the finals... yep pretty sure i guess...

at the first meeting with the teacher, he just asked ""and... are you sober yet?!"" with some of the [scariest rape face](http://i.minus.com/ifhutgqjrnmuj.gif) i have ever seen in my life...  
maybe he was looking forward to my finals  
.  
..  
...  
 

 i added some situation-related gifs...  
why?!  
because fuck you,  
that's why!","*i was so hammered that i said to my teachers wife ""my deepest condolences"" that she is his wife in my graduation year*"
469,"god fucking dammit. so i cheated super hard on my chem final exam (got the answers before the test), and proceeded to get a b (aka not failing the class). i was super fucking happy i hadn't failed.

my buddy knew i had it and asked if he could have it after i used it. i didn't care, but i told him that if he got caught, to, and i quote, ""not nark on me"".

he proceeded to use it, and get caught (you have to be real fucking dumb to get caught cheating in this class). and when he was threatened with 10 days (just a threat), he gave up my name. 

i have my morals. i knew that if i did get caught, that i would not give up who i got it from because fuck it, i made this bed, and i'm gonna have to sleep in it, but he fucking sold me down the river. so yep, here i am, suspended on the last fucking day of my junior year. i failed the class, btw.

 

edit: i went back after they got out to take my last final. after that i went to see the counselor, and managed to not need to take summer school! still have to retake it, but during next year so fuck it.",cheating doesn't pay
470,"i sometimes work from home, and today was one of them.  

needless to say, i am on reddit and facebook, while making calls.  in our work chat room (only for employees, no customers), a question was asked, which i knew the answer was in one of our blog posts, which are listed in a google doc.

i do my command c, command v and enter.

but the google docs and copy/paste gods hate me.  because...

earlier in that day, my friend was going through a divorce, and her stb ex-husband was making her life difficult.  i told her to send pics of some of her more intimate parts, and tell him that he used to own them, but now they belonged to someone else, her.  somehow it got to cow parts, so i googled a subreddit for cow udders to post, but just came up with a subreddit of women with huge tits that they were calling udders.   worked well enough for a haha.

except... instead of the support document link i wanted posted in my company chat room... it posted the dirty subreddit. 

yep.  lesson here kids:  look before you hit enter when copying and pasting.","i meant to send a support document to a chat room at work, but i sent boobies instead."
471,"ok so i didnt fuck up by going to the dentist. i'm glad i did. but i fucked up because over the past 5 years my old dentist said my teeth were fine and i just needed to brush and floss regularly. i'll admit i didn't floss nearly enough (like none at all), but every check up showed my teeth as healthy and cavity free.

my old dentist retired recently so i switched to a new dentist and went for a check up today. well we started off with a deep (fuckin ow) cleaning. my gums were bleeding all over the damn place. apparently dentists are supposed to dig in your teeth and get all the shit out from in between instead of just scrubbing the surface with fluoride. 

as my check up progressed, it became clear that i had some serious issues built up from over the years. my old dentist had told me i had healthy teeth when i actually had a total of 23 cavities. also my wisdom teeth are coming in (yay). 

i didn't think it was that big of a deal. i mean, i've had cavities before, i'll just get them filled. turns out, that many fillings is kind of really god damn expensive, and my insurance only covers $2000. so now i have to pay $3700 for all my fillings and shit.",i have a fuck-load of cavities and it's expensive.
472,"so, i'm out really late/early partying with friends because one was leaving today. we get back to this one guy's penthouse(a guy i met like two days prior), and continue to drink and smoke a few bowls.

so we are smoking a bit in this guy's bedroom because whatever reason. after smoking everyone slowly start headed back to the living room. it's down to me, penthouse guy's cousin, and this chick. i leave not thinking much of it, but about 15-20 minutes later everyone was going to head out to continue the party. so penthouse guy asks where his cousin was, and i told him i was pretty sure his cousin was in his bedroom. given the title, i am sure you know what he found. he comes out cursing and yelling loud enough for everyone to hear ""that bitch's tits are hanging out!"" he was furious, so we did a number of shots i am sure i don't want to remember.",told a prospective friend that his cousin was getting it on in his bed.
473,"i'll start of the story with why i was in such a jumpy mood. at about 6:30 this morning i started having this weird dream where my backyard was covered in spiderwebs and i started picking at the strings of one to get it to fall so that i could get across the yard and back into the house.

i think i was at the point where i was half-dreaming and half-awake and i swear to god i felt this big-ass spider land straight on my face in the dream and in real life at the same time. i instantly woke up and freaked out and jumped out of bed, and the ""spider"" flew off of me and onto the bed. i must have hallucinated because i swear i could actually see the spider there on the bed for a few seconds and then it vanished. the feel of it on my face and seeing it felt so real that i'm still not %100 sure that it didn't actually happen

after that living nightmare i decided i could no longer go back to sleep and went downstairs to take a shower. i started the shower up and took a piss in the toilet, then as i look over the the basket of towels by the shower there's this big ass brown spider right on one of the towels. deciding to be brave i lift the towel up and dangle it over the toilet and try to shake the spider off.

this spider definitely lifts and would not come off of the towel so i shook really hard and lost grip of the towel and of course it landed straight in the piss-water in the toilet. my immediate reaction was to grab the dry end of the towel and lift it out, and then of course the spider started running up the tower towards me to i let go of the tower and got piss everywhere. 

i then ran out of the bathroom ass-naked (luckily no-one was downstairs yet) grabbed a cup and trapped the bugger. to my credit i am not usually terrified of spiders but i do live in an area with brown recluses and this one looked too big to be a garden spider to me, although it most likely was not a brown recluse either. most embarrassing part is that i am a full-grown twenty year old man.","saw spider on towel, made piss-molotov cocktail with towel."
474,"so i’m relatively new to reddit but here's a shameful story that, although ended somewhat triumphantly, was a personal defeat.  this story is long and happened awhile back but i think a good one. i went camping with some friends and we just got back from drunken canoeing so we were extremely hungry. we started the fire and cooked burgers and hot dogs. while waiting for the food to cook we drank and smoked. after the festivities, we ate to our drunken hearts content. unfortunately, the pre game upset my stomach and for some reason caused me to only have partial control over my bladder. i don't know if the beer, or beer mixed with smoking caused this reaction but i couldn't hold in the undercooked food. so minutes later i can sense the explosive embarrassment wanting to project everywhere. i calmly collected my sporadic thoughts and told everyone ""be right back, going the bathroom."" luckily i got out of the shelter/cabin without anyone noticing the shit that was about to come out my ass. at this point my inner anguish is nervously creeping toward the surface and i become the worlds speed walking champion with ass cheeks clenched tight enough to hold a needle as i dash toward the bathroom. it was nighttime so my inner ninja kept telling me ""you did it /r/anoriginailname!!!!,no can see you walking idiotically....we're going to make it!!!!"" but...i failed and shit myself. the plopping noises of poop bubbles continued with every shameful step to the bathroom, which thankfully was empty. so there i sat, a defeated and ashamed 22 year old that just shit his pants. as every minute passed, the smell of burgers, hot sauce, hotdogs, beer, and bad times heighten my self-embarrassment. i kept telling myself that if i walked back to the campground it would be obvious by the smell and sight that i had shit myself. so i crafted a plan to prevent myself from being the humor for the next couple of years. frantically i began to wipe my trunks furiously with toilet paper removing the brown matter from my clothing. however, my actions were futile and caused a now smeared and worse mess. i was at rock bottom...and my dignity was near gone butt (hehe) then i remembered! earlier in the morning i had used someone’s shampoo they had left behind when i took a shower in the campground showers. this was my ace in the whole! so i wiped my ass and slowly crept around the corner in pink panther fashion avoiding any human contact. i open the shower door and…the shampoo is gone. fuck! so i open the next shower…nothing...i was getting hopeless and then yes!...the next shower over had a bar of soap. now normally i don't ever…ever, use some strangers random bar of soap…especially at a campground with hundreds of people but i had no choice (i’m just weird and feel grossed out that someone had possibly rubbed their sweaty balls with that soap but i guess i was about to do worse). i got on my knees and scrubbed until there were no more brown stains on my trunks. i washed my butt cheeks to their natural color and triumphantly stood proud knowing i avoided complete embarrassment. drunken head held high, i walked out of that shower feeling like a man but what goes up must come down.  while still in a drunken stupor i aimlessly walked back to my campsite and stepped on a thorn bush with all my weight (i was barefoot during this entire fiasco). at the time i was so drunk that a thorn going straight into my toe felt like a little prick but the next day proved me wrong. the thorn had gone in deeper than i realized and caused me to develop a slight pimp lean to avoid any pressure on my left toe (the toe closest to the big toe). so although i avoided embarrassment i still didn't win because walking for the next couple of weeks sucked. any pressure on that toe felt like the thorn was being re-inserted into the same spot but hey…no one knows i shit myself expect yall. thanks for reading.","drunken canoeing, smoking, and eating undercooked food made me a walking diarrhea dispenser and although public embarrassment was avoided, a painful pimp lean was developed."
475,"my friends and i decided to grab a few drinks (not beers but mixed tequilas and shit) it was pretty chill at first but after a few hours i said fuck it let's get wasted so we drank from one bar to another until we pretty much got carried away and i blacked out.

 the moment i gained consciousness, i was lying on the sidewalk next to the boarding house i live in (how could i miss?) checked what time it is--hold on, *where the fuck is my watch?* i got up and my feet felt wet, as i looked down--*where the fuck are my shoes?* i checked my pockets, all empty. also, my elbows were bleeding and my eyeglasses were missing. still too buzzed to care, i assumed i left my wallet and phone in one of the bars and tripped while walking home, so i just went inside and luckily the gatekeeper's there to open me up. 

next morning i asked my friend online if he remembers how i got home and where he last saw my things. he told me i never took out my phone the whole night, and he let me rode the taxi first. i may have left my wallet in the cab, but i can never remember that. still unanswered questions, i asked the gatekeeper to check if he saw my shoes outside and that's when he had a cleared doubt on his face and told me what he saw last night.

according to him, while he's peeking through the door he saw **a group of fucking thugs** circling me lying down on the ground. giggling. laughing. it was so dark he couldn't identify who i was so he just shrugged it off. i couldn't fucking believe it, i'm not sure if i got stripped off or looted and the only left of me was my clothes. i was almost afraid thinking about it and at the same time i wanted to punch my self in the face. now i'm phoneless, blind, broke and i'm too scared to go outside after what happened.

 

edit: if i have to pinpoint the blurry things of what i did during blackout, i can only remember being at the front table inside a strip club. my friend confirmed we actually did go to a strip club.","got wasted passed out on the street group of thugs ""looted"" my phone, wallet, watch, eyeglasses and shoes."
476,"i wasn't feeling good this morning but i decided to go to work anyway. it was just a stomach ache. surely i could push through it. so i go into work today only to find that they want me to stand in 106 degree weather for 5 and a half hours and keep tourists out since the business has a buy-out today. 

one hour into it, my stomach is in great pain, but i'm putting on a great act and doing my job. 45 minutes later, i'm dripping in sweat, dizzy and constantly taking breaks to go back in for some air. 45 more minutes later, the manager has me come inside to work at the counter because i can't even fucking stand at this point. first costumer i get asked me if i was okay, saying she thought i looked like i was going to pass out. all i could manage on the head set was ""jon, i'm not gonna make it"" before i ran to the bathroom. only to find that all the stalls are full. unable to hold it in, i throw up in the sink. then it gets clogged. i freak out and turn the water on, but it only gets more clogged. 
 
i had zero fucking clue what to do at this point, so i do what any good human with a soul would do, and walk out like a little bitch and hide in the break room. i eventually have to go back so that i can clock out and throw up some more, but i know that right now, at this very moment, one of my co-workers is plotting my death as they clean my puke out of a sink. i think i'm quitting..","went to work sick, stood in 106 degree weather for hours, puked in the sink, got it clogged, one of my co-workers is going to have to clean that shit up and is probably plotting my death at this very moment.."
477,"we were loading up the minivan with stuff, with my car parked next to it in the driveway. my little brother, for some reason, just wanted to stay in the car, so i opened the door and left the windows open (it was hot today). he kept on complaining that he was hot and didn't listen to repeated commands to just get out of the car. eventually, he told us he wanted some water. my mom was also getting a little irritated at both him and me, complaining the whole time about how all we do is just sit around and do nothing. i was getting a little irritated at this point. my mom reminds me that there is a bottle of water, but didn't specify where it was. i, being annoyed at my mom and forgetting that i left my car door opened, opened the passenger side of the van into my car door, in an attempt to look for this water bottle. my mom tells me that the bottle of water is in my car in the cup holder. she's already pissed off at this point by me and my brother, and it was at this point that she pointed out that there was a long paint mark left on the passenger side of the van. seeing this, she screams at me to leave and go back to our new house.

doesn't help that we just got our minivan back today, after spending over $3k to get the transmission fixed. my dad comes back at around 5:30 today and i don't think he'll be happy about the paint mark. when he gets super super pissed, he tends to let out his anger on inanimate objects. i anticipate my laptop and my phone to be potential victims tonight.","got a little annoyed by mom complaining i was a lazy slob, left paint mark on minivan in the process of looking for a water bottle to appease my little brother, and am anticipating my laptop and phone to be destroyed by my dad in a fit of rage tonight."
478,"title explains it all really, but i'll go into depth.

i have these females cousins who in my opinion are smoking hot, like seriously fit...one night i was staying over my 2nd cousins house for the night because my parents were out and couldn't trust me in the house alone. we were just talking late at night when she just kissed me..just right there and then, all i managed to say was ""what did you just do that for?"", when she kissed me again and again, eventually i gave in and we ended up having sex right there in her room.
     the next day i woke up stark naked realising what i did, popped on my clothes and went for breakfast..

later, around afternoon, i went to go and feed my nans cats whilst she was on holiday, and this time my first cousin was there(she goes round to our nans all the time because they have a very high gadget house). we're like really close and we got talking and i mentioned what i did last night.. she was shocked, obviously, i had sex with one of my cousins. then she kissed me. this time i had the chance to speak and said,""delilah we're cousins we can't do this, please"" which she then removed her trousers and top and climbed onto me. and i did it again, we had sex.. now one knows i've had sex twice, the other doesn't think i've done it with anyone else. and i'm no longer a virgin, maybe one thing comes out of it.
also we're all 15 years old.                                                                                                        don't worry though i still fed the cats",had sex with my cousins seperatley in less that a day
479,"so yesterday around 5 or so i met up with a friend for drinks. nothing to spectacular here, we drank, played pool, and did some shots....... quite a few shots. we ended up bar hopping and probably went to 4 or so bars(i believe). we ended up on his side of town near closing time, so we headed to his place to crash for the night, on the way there i informed my friend that i had taken some xanax earlier in the day
(about 1mg which is way more than i usually take for my anxiety but had a very stressful day) and that sometimes with that level of xanax in me and mixture of alcohol i can piss myself. he jokingly told me his son wasn't home and had plastic sheets if i needed. we make it to his place and drink a couple beers and i pass out on his couch. i wake up i'm guessing around 5 or 6 am and that's when i realized this wetness beneath me, i had pissed myself. this wasn't some tiny bit of piss. this was a case of beer been holding it in for a year type piss. so there i am laying in my own piss on my buddies couch, the first time i had ever been to his place. thoughts of killing myself playing through my mind. i figure if i do it right here on the couch maybe the blood will cover it, then again i'm sure my body would shit and piss when it's over anyways so that's not a good idea. i go and find a towel and lay it down hoping to soak it up, it did a decent job but not perfect. after many thoughts of what to do i fall asleep again, in my piss.

my buddy wakes up and lets his dog out. i wake up to this, realizing oh shit i pissed all over his couch wtf will i do? how do i tell him? do i tell him? hey maybe i can blame his dog.... yeah that will work.....  no that's fucked up i can't do that. so there i lay still on my piss..... get up and smoke a cigarette, bullshitting with my buddy.... and finally i say, ""so remember our conversation about xanax last night? well it happened."" he pretty much laughed about it and poked fun at me. i asked him if he had washer and dryer there he said yes, he needed to wash the couch covers anyways. he was really cool about as i'm embarrassed as all fuck. i apologize a thousand times, told him i was contemplating blaming his awesome dog(which in no way would work... at all) and he laughed some more. he gave me a ride to my car, i was 2 hours late to work, i'm now sitting at work feeling like shit still. 

a side note, i don't usually drink when i take xanax (breathing is good, i like to breath). it's not a good idea regardless if you sometimes piss yourself while drinking while on it. sadly i know better because this has happened twice before while on a high for me dose, but in the privacy of my own home. 

oh yeah, throw away, but i kind of like the name so i might just keep it.",i need diapers.
480,"i needed to look up information on what bill collectors are allowed to do (stupid verizon, different story.)  so i went to the public computer lab on campus. these particular machines are set up in really long rows with the tower on the desk next to the monitor and each computer/monitor evenly spaced. 

the only open computer was in the middle of a long row next to a girl who had about 5 documents open between spreadsheets, power points, word, internet and whatever. i tried to log in but it took longer than the 15 seconds i was willing to wait, so i assumed it froze and i needed to restart it. i reach up and hold down the power button of the closest computer in reach, but after about 5 seconds the tower went dark but my monitor didn't. weird, i think, but hey it finally logged me in! 

i look back at the now shut off computer, then over at the girls monitor and to my horror it's totally blank. i completely froze for what felt like forever but was probably a few seconds. i considered getting my crap and just bolting... maybe she wouldn't know it was me? after another second i manage to stammer out ""i just shut of your computer huh?"" the girl was really cool about it and made it seem like i didn't just totally ruin hours of work, but i felt like a freaking bafoon and just got my crap and left anyway.",accidentally turned off a girls computer on campus and probably destroyed tons of hard work. ran.

482,"so after school some of my friends and i decided to head by goodwill to buy some cheap clothes.  i set down my back pack, which contained my (300 dollar) glasses and new, somewhat expensive jacket.  soon a mega shopping spree ensues and completely forget about my backpack.

*fast forward 45 minutes...*

as we're leaving i decided to throw a hat that i bought into my backpack.  that's when i realize.  my jacket is missing.  thinking i must've just put it down somewhere, i rush back, telling my friends i'd be back soon.  i get back, and search the store.  i went everywhere, looked through every single rack of clothes.  it's gone. 

by the time my friends arrive, i've accepted the fact that it's gone.  defeated, we leave.  as we're walking out, i check my backpack for a soda i left to drink later.  and that's when i realize.  my fucking glasses are gone too.  we head back once again, but just like my jacket, they're gone without a trace.

i gave the store my phone number, and details about the missing items, but i believe they were stolen from my backpack.  the missing glasses will be a bitch being i can't drive anymore.  or see 15 feet in front of me.",traded a flannel and a hat for the ability to drive and warmth.**
483,"it's been a bad week for me. all i've been doing is fucking things up, today was not the exception. friday starts, school is having it's annual field day on a close track field, it's all about running. since days before the event, my sister (one year younger than me; i guess i can say she is chubby) has been saying that she is not going to run. 
the day comes, second event in her category, 50 meter run (i think). i'm waiting for the race i was going to participate to start. i tell her ""do your best"" and she looks at me in a ""bitch please"" way. the race starts, she is walking. at this point, her friends are almost getting to the finish line. our p.e. teacher tells her she gotta run, or else he will take 30 points of her grade (nice motivation, huh?).
i decided to run behind her and put my hand in her back to make her run a little (everything seemed perfect in my mind...). she starts running; the moment a placed my hand on her back, she loses balance and falls (i did fell too..). i get her up and she finish the race, everyone from her class and mine is laughing. she goes to the bleachers and went back to the waiting line; my friends are laughing, they think i did it as a joke. about 5 mins later i go to check on her. her right arm and knee got scraped and she is crying. she calls mom. mom is there raging at me. i feel like shit, tried to help my sister and end up hurting her when i'm supposed to protect her.
 
i can't get this feeling of guilt and remorse out of me.","i won the ""worst brother of the year"" and it's only april."
484,"my sister is in the army and has been having health issues.  today she went in to have a surgical procedure done.  the procedure took longer than anyone expected it to.  being the nurse of the family they all came to me and asked me to call and see what i could find out.  i tried to explain to them that we wouldn't be able to get much information until the procedure was over and because of hippa laws that i wouldn't even get that much information then.  they still wanted me to try.

this is where it gets a little tricky.  i call into the hospital and give them my name and the nurse apologizes profusely and puts me on hold. my first reaction is ""wow they have really nice nurses."" the next thing i hear is a nurse answering the phone, saying she is the charge nurse and that she will help any way that she can.  i explain to her that my sister came in to have a procedure done and that we have not yet heard anything and that it was distressing to the family. by this time i had switched into profession nurse mode and was very professional.  this time the charge nurse apologized that we had not heard anything at all and that it must have been an oversight and that she would find out anything she could.  i was on hold for maybe 5 minutes when the charge nurse came back (again apologizing for the delay) and told me my sister was in recovery and that everything had gone good.  then she proceeded to tell me every detail about the surgery, which doctor she had and how good he was.  at this point i hear her say, ""oh the doctor just walked onto the floor, hold one more second and you can speak to him.""  this time i spoke to the doctor and he went over it and explained in detail everything.  i could not believe i was getting all this information!  i thanked the doctor and said about how nice and accommodating everyone was and went to hang up.   

this is when i found out i had fucked up.  they answered with ""no problem colonel (insert my last name here), if you need anything else please call back!""

i was so confused i hung up.  about 15min later i got a return call (not sure how they got my number, caller id maybe) and i had an irrate nurse on the phone yelling at me for impersonating an officer and that it was punishable by jail time.  i tried to explain to her that at no time did i say i was an officer and i wasn't even aware they thought i was until we hung up.  the nurse, very agitated, goes.  i have the paper right here it says colonel (insert last name) is on the phone.  that's when it hit me.  i had to explain to this charge nurse that no i did not say colonel  i had said cornelia, my first name.  she was very flustered because i believe at this time she realized the hospital had violated some very strict hippa laws.  this time i apologized and hung up.

i am still waiting for the mps to call me. 

**",**  apparently my first name (cornelia) sounds like colonel when spoken to a busy nurse over the phone!
485,"a throwaway for obvious reasons.

tonight, i went to ihop. i usually do this with some friends, late night breakfast. sit down, chill, shoot the breeze and eat. i get my usual, bacon and eggs, with hash browns and pancakes. i decided to try something different, and get these pancakes that have like choco bits in them or something. i believe that's what set off the following unfortunate events.

we're done eating, and like we always do, we sit around and talk to each other and the waiter/waitress. i feel something a-rumbling downstairs. not sure if i should deal with it or not, i pass it off as just gas. mistake number one made. the sensation doesn't go away, and my friends and i head back to the car. in fact, the rumbling seems to be growing in intensity. again, being the idiot i am, i decide to just bear with it until i get home. mistake number two. no more than two minutes after driving away, i'm literally squeezing my ass cheeks together, trying to keep whatever beast is trying to rear its head out of my ass. i'm starting to sweat, concentrating on not letting anything spill out. i try to make up an excuse to my friends about why i'm sweating (since they are asking), and i roll down the window. i probably shouldn't have done that. i had to shift my position to be able to crank the handle of the window crank. mistake number three.

shit literally starts exploding out of my ass right then and there. i can fucking feel it, hot and gooey. this is definitely not good. here i am sitting in the car with a bunch of my friends, with liquid shite running down my pants and legs, and straight into my shoes. i'm pretty sure it went through both my boxers and my pants, and seeped into the damn car seat. i roll down the window some more so any smell that may have come from what just happened could hopefully ventilate out the window. so i sit in the car for the next 30 minutes, while we go around and drop off my other friends. after two friends get dropped off, one of my friends speaks up and mentions the smell of shit. fuck. i come up with an excuse that maybe we passed by something on the road. they buy it, but then roll up the window due to me trying to cover up my embarrassment. fortunately, i was the next to be dropped off. i get out of the car, and i don't look back. i didn't even bother to chance a glance at whether the car seat had shit all over it. all i could concentrate on was getting inside my house, burning my clothes, and weeping in the shower. i'm pretty sure they are gonna figure out that the smell had something to do with me. i'm gonna get shit about it tomorrow.",my ass turns into a volcano and spews liquid hot shit inside my friend's car.**
486,"last friday my friend j had surgery on his chest. monday morning he comes into our first period chemistry class and i give him the usual slap on the chest as a greeting (i'm not the least bit articulate verbally so i avoid speaking as much as possible) he winces and i ask why. he tells me he had surgery and that it was complicated to explain, but said he had a [port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/port_%28medical%29) removed. i'm not educated medically, and having severe adhd i quickly forget this. j is a pretty shy guy, even around his friends, and when word got out that he had surgery everybody was questioning him, and he always gave the same answer, ""it's hard to explain."", but being the curious teenager i am i kept prodding him for answers. school ends, and our group of friends is hanging out in the animation classroom at our school. finally, i blurted out ""what is it cancer or something? that's why your hairs so sparse right, chemotherapy? ""(he has the thinnest, waviest hair on a 17 year old you've ever seen) he stared at me for a second, like a *gollum assuming bilbo has the ring* stare, then quickly retorted ""no?"" after everybody else went home he asked me if was that obvious. i replied with ""not really."" we went the rest of the day as usual, did a quick bro-fist/daps, then went our separate ways.

still haven't mentioned anything about it and probably never will.

487,"so as a bit of background information, i tend to sleep on the couch in the living room, and pressed up against the back of the couch is my computer desk.


last night i fell asleep pretty early and wound up waking up around 3am, nothing to unusual. while laying on the couch i began redditing on my phone some and it was shortly thereafter i noticed that my older brother was using my computer judging from the furious clicking i figured he was simply playing some videogame. late in the night but not unusual as we all tend to be somewhat night owls. 
then i noticed a strange sound, sort of a rustling. and also the clicks per minute went wayyy down. odd i thought to myself, i wonder what he could be doing. oh god no. on my computer in the din of the night i then began to hear the tell tale signs of a fap session. a major one by sounds of it to, i could just faintly make out the sounds of ill repute from the headphones (my headphones!) he was wearing and some heavy breathing was definitely becoming a thing.
so there i lay, my brother about 6 feet away beating the bishop. my eyes wide and frozen in horror i lay there not sure of what to do. this went on for about half an hour to 45 minutes before he started clapping my mouse against the desk repeatedly, and then suddenly it was all over. his assualt on the clergy apparently over, my brother let out a very audible, ""whew"" turned off my monitor and hurried off upstairs presumably to bed.

i didn't get to sleep for the rest of the night, and i feel like my computer has been used and abused. my mind and brain are scarred. and nothing feels clean anymore.",woke up to my brother spanking the monkey on my computer a few feet behind me. pretended to be asleep. am scarred.
488,"in the spirit of good oral hygiene, i decided to use some of my fine listerine anti-cavity rinse this evening, which was located on the top of the cabinet in my bathroom.  it had no cap, but lots of our stuff has no cap... so i filled up the dispensing top and let it settle at the appropriate level.

into the mouth to start some vigorous swishing!

hmm... wtf is that granular stuff in my mouth?!  sugar? i proceeded to spit it out into the virgin white sink.

black.  lots and lots of black.

that isn't sugar my dear, it is m'fing ants!

i nearly vomited and am having a difficult time not vomiting as i type this now.

i went in search of some proper listerine to cleanse my mouth.  but it didn't solve the problem..  i still had this clenching sensation in my chest that something was amiss.

so i proceeded to make myself a knob creek (bourbon) and ginger ale.  which thankfully has made this much better... but that clenching sensation is still there.","i used some mouthwash, whose dispenser was a perfect trap for ants.  so i gargled with 25-50 dead ants and nearly vomited."
489,"so, i just got out of shower this morning and i though it was a great idea to prepare breakfast while naked. i tend to use more oil than i need in my food, and being a clumsy piece of shit and thanks to my slippery oiled hands, my hands slipped off the knife i was using and i accidentally dropped it. i felt a sense of pain, and when i look down, i saw blood.

the knife sliced the middle of my penis. so i dropped a knife on my dick.

thankfully it was a small knife, so i do not have any terribly bad injuries. i still have a thick bandage wrapped around my dick though.","accidentally dropped a knife on my dick while preparing breakfast. it is still attached to me, though."
490,"so me and my girlfriend just moved into an apartment together 4 nights ago and everything has been amazing so far. each night when i get home we have had the same routine, she cooks dinner and we eat, followed by hookah, weed, and alcohol and a good amount of sex. well last night was no different and this morning i woke up to go take my early morning shower before work only to see that she was awake, which she never is in the morning when i get up. i don't really think anything of it so i tell her good morning and go to take my shower. fast forward 20 minutes and i'm ready to go to work, and right before i'm about to leave she asks me to cuddle. i think ok why not i have 10 minutes i can spare, i'm one of those who is always early to everything. so i get into the bed and under the covers and low and behold she's stark naked and just gives me one of those you know exactly what i want right now looks and we proceed to engage in the horizontal mamba. afterwards i tell her to have an amazing day and im on my way to work when i notice i need gas. as im filling up it was time to take a leak. as i enter there is a man, who looks a little rough , taking his place at the urinal. now there are only 2 urinals in this bathroom and im not going to be the bitch who doesn't pee because there another guy at the urinal. so i go up and whip my buddy out of his hiding place and position myself. now guys you know that post sex piss that really just sprays everywhere like a damn fire hose? yes, i started to piss and it looked like someone has slide the windex bottle halfway between mist and laser and i was doing this all on his pants leg. this is when this fine gentleman decided that his best plan of action was to attempt to piss back at me.... yes you read that correctly, i mistakenly pissed on a random man and his plot of vengeance was to get in a piss war with me. i then yelled that i was sorry and got the fuck outta there.","if you piss on others, they'll piss on you."
491,"preface to my story - my cat has been sick. he has feline hepatic lipidosis. luckily he's doing ok, but the recovery food has put a dent in our accounts. (and there's a whole story regarding his diagnosis that i'm going to post. the first vet that i went to should not be allowed to consult with worried pet owners.)

rent was due this weekend. we needed a little extra to cover until next payday, so i went to get a payday loan. (i know they are awful but it was necessary.) the teller handed me the cash and i put it in my wallet (along with the money my bf had taken from his account) and then put my wallet in my purse. i walked out to my car which was parked directly in front of the doors. then i drove to the atm to deposit the cash. 

when i got there, i wanted to make sure i had the cash all facing the same way so that i wouldn't have to fumble with it at the machine. i reached for my wallet. it wasn't in my purse. it wasn't on the passenger seat. it wasn't anywhere in the car. 

i drove back to the payday loan place and looked in the parking lot. no luck. i went inside and asked the teller if i left it at her window. she said no.

i came home, grabbed my bf, and we went back to look around some more. nothing. checked the trash cans around the building in case they took the cash and dumped the rest. nope.

feeling like a fucking idiot, i came home and spent an hour and a half cancelling my cards and filing an online police report. now we're hoping that our parents will be able to help us cover the rent.

i needed to vent a little so i created this throwaway. thanks for letting me get this off my chest. seriously, i feel like such a dummy right now.

492,"this actually happened a year or so go. anyway, my friends have a golf cart that they got from their grandfather a while back. the cart had this little truck bed in the back of it you could hold onto, and it got to a top speed of about 10 mph. so, being immature we couldn't just drive it around, so we invented this game called ""shoe surfing"" it was where you hold on to the truck bed and keep your feet on the ground whilst the driver tries to shake you off. so your in a position where your ass is about 3 or 4 inches off of the ground. it was my turn and i was doing pretty well. i was on for about 3 or 4 minutes, then i feel the worst possible pain ever...in my ass. i scream so loud, and keel over on the ground clutching my asshole. i look down to see a stick as thick as a stereotypical black man's dick next to me. i put piece by piece together and realized that with my feet so close together and my ass 3 inches from the ground, my feet picked up the black dick stick and wedged it between my asshole and the ground, with the cart going top speed. thankfully, it didn't go inside my asshole, but i still, to this day have learned my lesson. during activities in the backyard, don't leave black dick sticks lying around.",- asshole + black dick stick = pain
493,"not that it really matters, but this actually happened a few years ago while i was working at a grocery store. 
so, i'm working as a seafood clerk and, as part of my uniform, have an apron on. i take my dinner break and, before heading downstairs to resume my shift, decide i need to take a piss. i should also mention that i'm a bit tired and the fluorescent lighting in the store was not helping me keep my eyes open and my mind sharp. 

standard procedure, zip down the fly on my jeans and pull my apron to the side. everything is fine for a few seconds until i somehow let go of my apron and start pissing all over it and also partially on the button area of my jeans (because of back spray). thankfully, no one else was in the employee bathroom while i was and i was able to clean up.

i went back downstairs to the seafood counter and convinced my boss that i had forgot my apron at home, even though she saw me with it on earlier that shift.",took a piss at work while wearing an apron and ended up pissing on my apron and jeans by accident.
494,"i am a college student who works for a moving company part time. today i was on a move and the lady had a very nice china cabinet. i took out all the china and wrapped it perfectly, next i started wrapping the cabinet with moving blankets. all seemed well and i got my partner to help me pick up the cabinet and move it. well we pick it up and it tilts just a little bit and then we hear a loud crashing noise come from inside the cabinet...

open up the cabinet and i forgot to take out the glass shelves. mirrors on the inside busted along with the glass shelves.

needless to say the lady was not very happy and we didn't get a very good tip.",". before moving a china cabinet, be sure to take out the glass shelves"
495,"today, i went surfing, and as some surfers know, you either bring your keys in the water in your wetsuit, or you toss em in a bush nearby, especially if they are the electronic type like mine. now i know you think well thats dumb but after doing this hundreds of times in my many years of surfing i thought getting my car stolen would never actually happen. 

so i go surf for two hours and have some of the most fun waves i've had in a long time. on my way back as stoked as can be my friend who i was with asks me, ""gdshred95, where is your car?"" i responded ""shut up what are you talking about,"" do a double take, and see that my car is in fact gone. we call the police and go through the whole process of trying to trace our phones but unfortunately this guy was smarter than we thought and shut both of them off. after all this we are told that our case is of low priority but that they will be on the lookout. that sounded promising. long story short all my valuables such as wallet and phone were in there and now i am waiting and hoping my car has not been taken to a chop shop, is still intact, and is found. 

it is ironic how such a great day can end in a shitty way.","don't get your car stolen by trying to hide the keys nearby, car thief's aren't that dumb."
496,"so there i am. the fridge door is open and my stomach is growling. ""i want to eat something with substance, but i don't want to invest any time into cooking it"" i said to myself. ""oh sweet! there's a hard boiled egg, but its cold. i hate cold things that are supposed to be warm. lets just throw it into the microwave for a minute!""

so the eggs in the microwave and since i've never done it before i take it out when i think its ready. 

seemed warm enough to me so i peeled off the shell and got ready to dive into this warm eggy delight of mine that i was holding in my hand. as soon as i bit into the egg, all shit just broke lose and the thing literally exploded in my mouth. and when i say exploded im talking like high pressure, heat, flying lava egg pieces everywhere. i was stunned and had no fricken idea what-the-fuck had just happened.
  


... turns out its not ok to put hardboiled eggs with their shells on in the microwave because pressure will build up in the shell and then blow up in your face...

497,"this happened a couple weeks ago but i had only started lurking on reddit then.

came home from work, went to get a drink. we had a leaky pipe which was giving the neighbour below fits, so a plumber was in the house all that evening, effectively blocking kitchen and bathroom.

still, i really wanted something to drink, so when i saw half bottle of gingerbeer on the windowsill of our upstairs room i thought it was just good fortune and poured away.

i took a nice big gulp and nearly choked myself, it tasted fucking infernal. spat it out and chucked the whole thing out thinking the sun had done something unspeakable to the bottle of gingerbeer.

after a while i happened to mention it to my oh, and he sort of went still. ""...wait, where'd you find the bottle?!?""

the plumber was there for ages, and he'd ended up having to relieve himself in a bottle from the recycling. he left it where he wouldn't forget to get rid of it.

i boaked. but it was funny afterwards, i have to admit.",piss and gin do not a delicious beverage make.
498,"i finally arive at my school, and park in a spot. i unplug my auxiliary cord that connects my phone's headphone jack to my car stereo, and put it in the pocket of the zip up hoodie i was wearing. i then grab my backpack on the passenger seat, and pull it over to the driver seat while i was getting out of the car. i turn my head away and feel something pull back when i put the backpack on. i look and notice that my coat's sleave got tangled in the strap so i have to untangle it.

while i was untangling it i forgot that my phone was in the pocket of my hoodie (i should have put it in my pants pocket). i get the coat untangled and leave it in my car. i shut the door and take 2 steps, then i hear the dreaded sound that strikes fear into the hearts of all, except the gods of nokia.
 my phone hit the ground, landing in a puddle. i grabbed it off the ground and wiped the water off of it. it was really cloudy, so i thought it was fine, hoping that it was unharmed by the merciless pavement that has doomed so many. but alas, as i walked through the doors, i saw it. a spiderweb crack in the top right corner of the screen. taking up a little less then a quarter of the screen.

fuck.

early this morning while i was asleep, i was dreaming that i was using the bathroom and browsing reddit on my phone.  some thread was calling for /u/andrewsmith1986 to be banned or something and i was typing a response when i noticed how soft the carpet was in the dream bathroom and started to run my hand over it as i did my business.  in reality, i was stroking the blanket over my face and pissing myself.  this was when i woke up.",stroking dream carpet results in pissing myself
500,"so, today (as in earlier in the week) i almost killed myself by suffocating on water vapor in my shower. or would that be drowning? anyway, to the story:

my bathroom is almost airtight with the door closed, with only 2 small windows (one of which is jammed) and a really, really bad extractor fan/heat lamp thing. it's so bad at its job that usually i have to have both a window open and the fan going to get an adequate amount of steam from the shower out. this day however, i was in such a rush to get clean for upcoming activities that i neglected to open the window. this was a huge mistake.

as i am getting busy with the soap after spending a long time contemplating unimportant things as i often do in the shower, i notice i'm starting to have trouble breathing. i put it down to there being too much steam in the shower box and make to turn and open the shower door - and i slip on something. bang. next thing i know, i'm flat on my naked ass in the corner of the shower box, and my vision's going funny - blotches of colour dancing everywhere, blacking out now and then - and i realise i'm in deep shit. the shower head's still relentlessly beating down on me with hot, steamy water, my head hurts *bad* and i'm finding it increasingly difficult to breathe.

at this point i'm taking gigantic gasping breaths trying to get enough oxygen in me, but just sucking in more steam. i felt really, really weak. like i couldn't even move if i tried. but somehow i did. i'm not sure of what exactly happened, but evidently i made a desperate lunge for the door as my next memory is me laying face down butt naked half-out the shower door with the thing still going and me gasping like a fish out of water.

from that day forward i always, *always* made opening the window my first priority when taking a shower.",i learnt the importance of good airflow in a bathroom.
501,"i work in a cocktail lounge with an assortment of different spices, garnishes, fruits, and what have you to make all sorts of weird drinks. tuesdays are usually quiet, so i get to work alone and do homework until customers come in. today, my bar manager was in working on a couple new drinks that apparently involve red hot chili peppers. i'm talking red hot. one of my coworkers had been in when i arrived, and was on his way out when he saw a bowl of the little peppers, broke one open, smelled it, and chomped on it. he said it had smelled sweet, but burned like the hot sun, and he spent the next ten minutes trying to douse the spice. i like spicy food, and i was curious, so i broke one open and smelled it. it smelled sweet, so i squeezed a bunch of seeds out and put the pepper in my mouth. even before chewing, i felt that motherfuckers heat. i threw the pepper in the garbage and decided i'd save myself the 20 or so minutes of pain and scorched gums. i went to take my daily pre work dump, and sat down to check my phone, and went for the classic 'i've been busy all day and really need to just scratch my balls' move. bliss. about 45 seconds later, i stand up and walk out of the bathroom to feel a curious tingling, and then full on raging wildfire all over my balls. 

fuck. wow. ouch. 

i know milk neutralizes the capsaicin that irritates your nerves and causes spice, so i went to look for some in the bar. none to be found. i did, however, see the coffee i had just bought, and realized that i had put a fair amount of cream in it. bam. in my rush, i grabbed my coffee, walked into the washroom, locked the door, and started scooping some of the coffee onto my balls, hoping to get enough of whatever neutralizes the spice onto my crotch. i'd just gotten that coffee. hot coffee, even with milk, does nothing but make it worse. i know that now. 

next, i was off to the internet. 'what neutralizes hot pepper oils?' milk...yoghurt...lemon juice.....sour cream....

fuck...i didn't have any of those dairy products...but...lemon juice? fuck it. i'm in pain, ill try anything. filled a shot glass with lemon juice, back to the washroom, rubbed some cold lemon juice on my junk. nope. if anything, it made it worse....yeah, citric acid on your jewels doesnt feel great. i gave in and just started scooping handfuls of cold water from the tap to my crotch. each scoop doused the flames temporarily, so i did this for about 3 minutes before i realized i had to get back out to the bar.

there's nobody here, thank god, so i've been sitting and trying to ignore the now dull throb of flames between my legs.","my balls hurt, they taste like coffee, and they smell like lemons."
502,"so yeah, i attended our annual departmental christmas party, which takes place in our communal area with shittonnes of free booze (free. booze.) and being of the student persuasion myself, i have this inherent drinking problem. especially when the drinking becomes free.

i meet my already horrendously drunk friend who had called me on my walk there, apparently from the bathroom urinals (while screaming down the phone that he was not drunk, that he was hideously drunk, and that he was currently urinating).

so i get to the party, i grab a couple beers, some mysterious little old lady coerced me into drinking some of her special vodka, i pour the rest of my vodka cup away while she's not looking, drink more beer, say some cringily depressing things to an older guy i used to work with, proceed to pour beer number 3 down myself and others, older guy leaves awkwardly and we go gather our drunk friends to go home and/or to more bars.

we lost really drunk best friend on the way out so i try to go find him. i find him staggering around outside in the rain where he proceeds to lunge at me for an aggressive kiss and i'm like ""wha- oh, heeeeyyy"". how romantic *cue cheesy music they play in 90s films when the two main characters finally fucking kiss after dancing around the issue even though they're 30+ fucking years old and should really not be shy about that shit anymore*. 

some stuff is a little blurry in between, but he's misplaced his workbag or something and that somehow leads to some fumbling attempt at fornication over his work desk. that didn't work out, i loose him again, and errybody meets back at his place to check on him and his equally drunk roomate who has decided his final resting place for the evening is the kitchen floor rather than his own bed.

we leave our fallen drunkard friends with glasses of water beside them and head out for another bar, when suddenly...
drunk best friend calls me back up and disregarding my friends' pleas i trudge back upstairs to innocently see what he wants. 

-mistake #1 right here folks.-

i tuck him in, and i feel the best way to describe what happened next is ""*well officer, one thing led to another, and...*"" then somehow some sexual touching happened and then some sex happened.

my drunk brain decided that since it was aunt flow time, he should probably not stick it in there. *yo dawg, there's no blood coming out of the other hole right now, we could use that one* said brain, which my mouth translated as some unintelligible clumsy dirty talk and, lo and behold, butt secks  happened too ... during the course of which we removed panties filled with wadded tp i stuck in there earlier to stem the flow of unexpected party period blood, and my jacket and top somehow got ripped on the way off.

butt secks happened for a couple of fucking hours, during which i'm pretty sure i peed myself a little bit on more than one occasion. apparently i am also loud and his fucking bedroom door was fucking open too.

he wanted to cuddle afterwards (aww) but i decided to take the waddle of shame at 2am when no-one was around to see it.

-mistake #2: no condoms involved-

yuuup. aside from the fact i had to change my underwear when i farted and couldn't stop farting, i should *probably* go ask for some preventative meds since i don't how how clean he is (sleeps around a lot, not sure if he's always safe when doing so).

and ... i'm supposed to be spending another xmas party at his in a few days. i don't think i could look him in the eye right now.

504,"i'm an interesting person in that i'm both a light and heavy sleeper at the same time. what i mean by that is that is quite difficult to wake me unnecessarily, but i am still fully aware of and will react to most interruptions as if i were awake, and will will even wake up fully if i need to. this has lead to some interesting situations, including but not limited to: holding conversations i don't remember, throwing objects at intruders, sending text message replies, and turning off the air compressor outside my room. sometimes, if my subconscious deems it important enough, i'll even leave myself a mental sticky note, like ""check your phone"" or ""your mom wants something."" today was no different.

  i had been asleep roughly an hour, when my phone buzzes. i remember this because the only calls i get at 8 am are either collections, or important/emergencies. i see the unknown number and write it off as the former, and just let it go to message and go back to sleep. i woke up properly rested at 10, and realized i had one of those mental sticky notes for myself. ""check your phone"" it said. i was a little confused by this, as i had no missed calls shown, no new voicemail, and no new text messages. by pure luck, my finger accidentally twitched and pulled up the recent call log. one call answered, today, at 8 am. this wasn't right. i had let that one go, or so i thought. oh well, what's done is done, better move on to damage control and see which collections agency will be harassing me this month. on to google!

  this is where it gets a little interesting, as the unknown number was completely unlisted, and the only information i could find was that it was local (obvious anyways) and that it was a land line. after a few minutes of intense internal debate, curiosity overcame caution, and i called the number. they answered it on the first ring, and in an energetic, fast voice they say ""hello this is i'mgoingtospeaktoofastforyoutounderstandwhati'msaying desk. how may i help you?"" interesting, this scenario was unexpected. not wanting to ask her to repeat herself, i kindly explain i had received a call from this number, and then the voice at the other end asked me if i knew anyone who worked there, or if i was applying for work.

  oh shit. i knew who this was. the words she said at the beginning had untangled, and suddenly it all clicked. this was somewhere i had just sent my resume off to. this was a job i actually wanted. and i'm desperate for work. but mostly, this was a job that i wanted. i told her that yes, i had in fact just recently applied for work there, and she transfers my call to the right department. this time, i get an answering machine. so, i left a message explaining who i was, what my plight was, while omitting a few unimportant details, and end the call.

  now i am left wondering how badly i fucked up, what, if anything, asleep me said, and if they are still interested in hiring me.

 

update: they called me back and still want to do the interview! i guess i didn't fuck up too badly after all!",fry used snore! it's super effective!
505,"so today was one of those days where i lost the motivation to go to class, and i decided instead to kill some time at the mall. 

i had a dear old time, walking through the mall to get to the bookstore. i walked in, checked out one of grisham's novels, thinking i would buy it. i decided against it, and wandered around the store some more. i read a couple of chapters of another book, then decided to leave. i figured it was time for lunch. 

i take the escalator up to the mall food court, and turn to my right thinking to myself: ""i'm thinking arby's."" but little did i know this would seal my fate. as i turn the corner, half asleep, thinking about the books i read, there she stands: a girl i went to high school with, who has major attachment issues. (to put it into perspective, when her last boyfriend dumped her, she went into a 2 year cycle of depression and trying to get him back. two whole years of that shit. which she clung to me to cause apparently i was one of her best friends. so fuck. i thought i was rid of her.) she runs up to me, super excited, and i didn't even motion for a hug. she opens her arms and throws them around me screaming ""oh my god i miss you"". not wanting any of that i kinda just squeaked out a ""hey, how are you?"" and as a courtesy (and not wanting to go home quite yet) i decided i'd sit with her through her lunch. 

we got to talking about basic things. school, work, plans for the future, that sort of stuff. i'm on meds that make me drowsy so i kept yawning a lot, and she remarked how i needed to sleep more, and i always responded by saying that's not happening, and how i'm too busy with papers and test to sleep. so we chatted for a few more minutes, and she had to go to work. my car was in the same direction, so i went with. 

we were walking, and things suddenly got so much worse. she puts her arm in mine, and she starts talking about buying matching onesies and how much we'd need to hang out. i immediately said i'm not going to buy a onesie, or ever wear one. that i have a robe for a reason, and that i blatantly refuse to wear such an atrocity. when it came to hanging out, i always responded with a maybe or eventually.  everyone who knows me know that if i say one of those two words to you it's a solid but more polite no, and everyone knew that in high school. but not her.  i guess i shot myself in the foot with that one, cause she still thinks i'm open to hanging out. she tries to drag me into her store (which is a women's clothing and lingerie store) saying i have to meet everybody. i tell her no, that i got to go and study. so i say goodbye, and i walk off. not more than 30 seconds later, as i walk into the discovery hut, she texts me saying ""hi! lol"".

at this point i'm just thinking to myself how much of an idiot i am. i should have just said hi, gotten my food, walked to my car and drove away. instead, i sat there and talked to this girl who goes bat shit nuts easily. i text one of my friends, explaining what had just happened. she's laughing at me saying: 

""she jump on that dick faster than sonic in a speed race damn my nigga. you betta watch out for that one honey, she a find where ya live so fast, be outside ya window right when you get home singing 80's power ballads with an acoustic guitar, just strummin away. bust that door open bam she naked on the floor with some rose petals strewn on the bed n shit. she gonna shimmy up that drain pipe of yours too my nigga. you feel? she agile as shit you better recognize."" (my friend and mall-girl used to be friends by the way.)

so since then (this happened a couple of hours ago) i've refused to respond to her text, and since i know turning her down will make her go nuts, i'm thinking of going to the bar, and drinking myself into a coma to not deal with.

----------","i went to the mall, ran into a girl i thought i was done with who has major attachment issues, and i don't want."
506,"ok, not exactly today, but on a sunday a few weeks ago, and no, it did not involve anyone shitting themselves.

i was hanging out with some friends and my crush. we were all derping about at the 1.5m end of an olympic sized pool, playing tag, fighting with giant noodles, usual pool stuff. my crush randomly decides to swim to the other side. i thought to myself, ""hey, maybe i could swim to the other side too. what could go wrong?""

for my entire life i thought i was slightly better than the average swimmer. i was about to be proven wrong the hard way.

i started swimming, moving my arms, paddling my feet and whatnot in what i thought was a rhythm/pattern. but regardless, so far so good. i made it to halfway across the pool when my stamina suddenly decided to drop like an anvil. i thought, ""maybe i should just pause there a moment. no worries."" 

what i normally do to regain stamina is sink, then rebound at the pool floor in a forward thrusting motion. i do just that. after my whole body went a foot or two downward, i felt a disturbance of some kind. my feet have not yet made contact with the pool floor. i immediately figured that the pool was too deep, and so i doggy-paddled sideways, lunged for a lane divider, grappled it and then hauled myself to the other side of the pool with as much effort as i humanly could.

i grabbed on to the edge and then looked up to see the lifeguard looking down at me. he asked if i was okay, and i responded with ""yeah"". he then asked something like ""do you have any idea how deep the pool is?"" i looked back at him, confused. i then looked at the depth label in front of me. it said ""4m."" i was all like ""...damn."" i then got out of the pool and then examined it. i realized that i have lost all my stamina in the middle of the pool, where it was 5m deep.

promptly, i went back to the 1.5m end, trying to shake off the fact that i'd almost drowned that day. my friends and my crush had seen everything, and my crush in particular said something like, ""dammit ve2519, you don't know how to swim properly! i'll make sure to spontaneously give you a swimming lesson whenever we meet here... =)"" she almost never let me live it down from that day on.

[",] learned the hard way that i've been lying to myself my entire life about my ability to swim.
507,"i work at this deli shop and its my second week working.  so, there i was, slicing all kinds of meat using the slicer.  i was already doing some minor fuck ups through out the day but the major one was when i was slicing.  the security alarm control is right next to the slicer up against the wall and on there is a button to call the cops.  well, to clean the slicer, i have to move it and its right next to the alarm.  i must have bumped the button while i was cleaning it or working the slicer because 2 cops showed up all pissed off that it was a false alarm and now the store could be fined.  outfuckingstanding.",i fucked up by accidentally pressing the silent alarm to call the cops while working the slicer and now the store could be fined for a false alarm.
508,"its been a long night, i'm 16, on a wednesday night, doing some chores after the lady-friend had left, and i grabbed some kool-aid (because i'm 5 on the inside.). i had one glass at first. then another. then another. then another, and i think i got up to 13 glasses of kool-aid by around 7:30. so, naturally, around 8:15, i really have to piss... 

my brother was in the main bathroom however, and my mother was in hers. so i had to hold it. and i waited... for what seems like an *eternity*. i eventually got to the point where i couldn't hold it any longer. so i ran to the main bathroom door, and it's one that can be unlocked from the outside, so i quickly unlock it, and i step halfway in to see my brother, bent over the toilet, johnson in one hand, laptop on the counter, crankin' his shank. he sees me, loudly yells ""fucker!"", tries to run and jump into the shower, only ending up in him slipping on a towel on the floor, and smashing his face on the side of the bathtub. 

i start laughing **hysterically**. completely oblivious to the fact that i still had to piss like a motherfucker. i'm rolling on the floor, laughing, when my bladder can't handle it anymore, and just releases.

so now, i'm writing this, after i've thrown my favorite shirt and pants into the wash, smelling like piss, while trying not to think of the image of my brother jerkin' his gherkin. and yes, he was fine, probably gonna have a nice black eye though.

 

**edit:** answers to a couple questions.

1. i didn't pee outside because i live in maine, and at night, it gets cold, cold enough that my golden stream would freeze as soon as it left my piping. 

2. i never thought of peeing in a bottle... i shoulda done that... but then this all wouldn't have unfolded as it did, and it wouldn't be as funny.

3. i am of the male gender.

4. my brother is 14. makes it a little worse, doesn't it?","had to piss bad, walked in on my brother masturbating, he freaks out, trips and hits his face off the bathtub, i laugh, then piss myself."
509,"i actually shaved my nether regions about 3 days ago, but it caught up with me this morning when i was at work. i made the mistake of using a cheap single blade razor to shave the base of my no-no zone and got a really bad regrowth irritation.

it started out as a little itching, but eventually became so irritated that it felt like a a cactus was rapidly growing out of my pubes. i was able to scratch furiously and discreetly, but after a while the pain/itch became so intense, i was scratching every three seconds. it made the last 3 hours of work utterly unbearable. i contemplated euthanasia several times.

i work as a truck driver and i was inside of a refrigerated warehouse unloading an entire truck load of pallets. i managed to duck behind pallets to obscure my scratching, but i'm almost certain that a guy saw me liking down my pants like i had never seen my own penis before. i'm pretty sure everyone there thinks i have an std or something. i thought maybe that the cold air was irritating me, so i put on lotion. didn't help. then i put on gold bond. nothing! 

it was the worse thing i've felt next to a sprained ankle that swole to the size of an idaho potato. the itching and scratching gave way to a stinging pain like hundreds of tiny needles poking me in the pubes. 

eventually, i finished working, got in my 18 wheeler, and cleaned and reapplied gold bond to the affected area. this time, i felt the cool, fiery burning of mentholated gold bond and immediately regretted my decision. so i cleaned it again, and just grabbed as much ice shavings as i could from the freezer and put them on my raw junk. after three helpings, i was able to get to the nearest store to purchase a bag of ice and wore a plastic baggy filled with ice cubes for the next hour and a half. after a while, everything was so numb, i couldn't feel the pain.

needless to say, i'm never shaving again. i'd rather die.",shaved with cheap supplies. feels like a cactus is growing out of my junk.
510,"today i had an advising appointment to schedule my classes for next semester, and due to more than a few extenuating circumstances, i hadn't really put much thought into it. 

i should explain that my university is fairly small, and in some schools (like mine) the professors are also advisors. i happen to be in this particular professor's class this semester.

so i go in, obviously flustered because i have no idea what the fuck i'm doing, hand over my advising report, and launch into an explanation on why i didn't turn in my bibliography on monday because i was sick and in a sudafed coma (though i didn't actually call it that).

getting on with the actual advising, she looked over my papers and asked me about my plan. i admitted to only having a rough one because i may not be coming back in the spring due to financial reasons. she tried to move on, but some idiocy compelled me to explain my situation (like she cared) and ended in me saying, ""so basically i'm up shit creek without a paddle."" she sat at her desk looking utterly dumbstruck, and after what felt like forever, she asked me if i'd considered counseling. i said i had gone but had stopped for a few reasons, one of them being that my parents had called the on-campus counselor demanding my records, which by policy they could not release. 

""have you talked to the dean?"" she asked. 
""no,"" i said. ""but i think my parents have called her, or her office, at least. they're trying to withdraw me without my consent.""
""why?"" she asked.
""cause they're assholes,"" i replied, instantly wishing i hadn't. 

a long-winded conversation later, she calls the dean of students. shit. i really need to learn to keep my mouth shut sometimes. 

""i have a student here who has a very....complicated situation,"" she says, and launches into a description of it, down to my asshole parents demanding information from every office on campus and refusing to pay my tuition (when they promised they would). a few minutes after i asked to speak with the dean, she hands the phone to me.

""hello?"" says the dean. ""professor ____ tells me you have an interesting situation.""

""it's not so much interesting as it is...."" i'm searching for any term but fucked up. i mean, this is the dean of students i'm talking to. let's keep it professional here.

in the meantime, she goes on a rant about counseling and confidentiality. i am getting rather fed up with everybody (and it's more than these two) telling me i need counseling. i don't need to prattle on about my feelings, i need to get my ass out of trouble to avoid getting kicked out of the university for not having my tuition paid. 

""yes, but i'm looking at this more from a logistical standpoint,"" i interrupted. she doesn't seem to hear and goes on about counseling.

i let her talk for a minute or so before i finally lose it and practically scream into the phone, ""i know what i have to do, i just need to figure out how to go about doing it!!!!"" my advisor's eyebrows skyrocket into her hairline. i'm usually very quiet. 

a few more seconds of ""blah blah blah counseling,"" and she hangs up. my advisor is getting antsy because she's late for a meeting (and also probably due to the scene which has just unfolded. thank god the door was closed), and i gather up my stuff, apologize profusely, and bolt out the door. 

i don't know how i'm going to go to class on monday.","said a few choice words to my professor/advisor, and yelled at the dean of students over the phone. maybe i really do need therapy..."
511,"not strictly today. last weekend.

here goes anyway.

picture the scene. my friend's family is having a large-scale housewarming party. it is a large house - think, six bedrooms. detached. in the countryside. with stables. and horses. there was a marquee. i am not able to visit an off-licence/supermarket before traveling out into the sticks for the party, so i get my friend to buy me alcohol. he does the sensible thing, and instead of buying me beer or some other such normal man-beverage, he buys me a large bottle of white rum.

everyone arrives at the party in the early evening. the many people present include the extended family of my friend who has just moved house, their family friends, a lot of our friends, friends of the other friend's siblings, you get the idea. there couldn't have been less than 80 people there. anywho, being the trouper that i am, i drink the bottle of rum over the course of the evening. the whole bottle. neat. i also eat chilli con cane. which is nice. it's after midnight. i'm outstandingly drunk but holding my shit together. did i mention that my friend who's hosting the party is into his illicit substances? we go out into the fields surrounding his new house, and we smoke weed. a lot of weed.

now i hadn't been familiar with the adage ""alcohol then grass, end up on your ass"" before, but i can now say with confidence that it is a proverb worth remembering. we come in from the field, outrageously pissbaked. we sit/lie in his room for a while. i'm in a good place. and then it happens. a vomitous parabola the likes of which i've never seen before explodes forth from my mouth, in shimmering brilliant orange (chilli), and this is where things get hazy... my rum-purchacing friend does his level best to deal with me, but there's parents shouting about orange sick on the ceiling of their new house and i don't really remember much other than anger and my poor friend trying to defend me...

i wake up the following morning hugging the bowl of the upstairs toilet with a head like corned beef and barbed wire. i slink off as discretely as i can. my girlfriend, who had been absent from the party asked me how it had been. i lied. i said it was calm. normal. back at college this week. sitting next to my girlfriend. my friends are sniggering, and i ask them why, and although they'd done my best to not tell me the true extent of the horror, there was no way they were going to be able to contain themselves.

i had been passed out hugging the toilet bowl. the drunken senile grandmother of the friend who had moved house was upstairs. she needed to use the toilet. she was incapable of going downstairs to use one of the many toilets downstairs. i had been unresponsive to any stimulus, and as such, she came up with her own novel solution to the problem.

she simply moved my hands off of the toilet seat.

and pissed.

legs astride my unconscious form.

my girlfriend asked if that was what i considered 'normal'. i held my head in shame as every single one of my friends laughed until they fell on the floor. i, truly, had fucked up.

 

edit: language as suggested",got pissbaked. vomited. passed out hugging a toilet bowl. a drunken senile grandmother urinated in the toilet anyway. my girlfriend wasn't impressed.
512,"okay so i'm a freshman in college who managed to walk on as a weight/shot put thrower. after working very hard all fall and winter i managed to make the team, and the coach was really starting like me. until this morning.... today was my first ever college track meet, and the bus was set to depart at 7am in the morning. i was really excited and ready to compete for the first time. i had packed my bag and laid out my uniform the night before to make sure absolutely nothing could go wrong. i even managed to get myself to bed by 11 on a friday night, i set three alarms on my phone, and made sure i had a buddy(who lived on my hall) who would wake me just in case something went wrong. everything was in place and nothing could go wrong...

except, life has a sick sense of humor. first thing i did was manage to disable my phone while sleeping. i keep my phone under my pillow(i've always done that, makes sure i wake up, hasn't failed me in years) and this one night i managed to swipe my hand under my pillow and knock it off my bed. it's an old phone so that knocked the battery out of it....my alarm is now totally gone.

no worries, my friend should would make me up, right? no of course not. why the fuck would life make this so easy on me? my hall mate actually just left without me. just fucking left. the bitch texts me from the bus....""i'm sorry, i totally forgot to check for you."" yeah i'm sorry too. i want to blame everything on her, but that's unfair.

instead i wake up to my roommate asking me what i'm still doing in bed at 7:30. my first thought was that this could only happen to me. then i searched for my phone, which was supposed to be my alarm, only to find it on the ground with the battery next to it. i put it back together, turned it on, and found 7 missed calls and 12 texts from my coach and my teammates. first thing i did was call my coach back. why? idk. i was panicking. this is how the conversation went....

coach: ""hey, good morning!"" (very sarcastic tone throughout)
me: ""good morning coach..."" (just loud enough for him to hear)
coach: ""how are you feeling?""
me: ""real shitty...""
coach: ""yeah me too... look, how about you get some more sleep and we'll talk about this monday.""

*click*

all of this happened after all of our coaches warned us about not being late over and over again all week, to which i would reply ""no worries. i'm going to be there. guaranteed.""

513,"this happened in fall of 2012. i live in chicago and it was one of those windy, freezing days. anyway...

i comb my hair, all is well, though the comb is a bit scratchy and rather flimsy, oh well. time to comb my beard. left side, no tangles. awesome! right side, the comb seizes about half way through...damn, got a tangle or a knot. 

i think to myself, ""fuck it! i'll just pull it through, either the hairs will untangle or they're comin' out."" pull. pull. pull. ow, this hair is rather tenacious...

***yank!***

there we go, no more knot. at this time i notice one of the combs teeth is bent almost completely backwards, about 160 degrees away from where it should be. i inspect the area of the supposed  tangle and find a decent sized bead of blood instead.

""what the fuck was wrong with this hair?""

upon further inspection, i realized that under the tiny horizontal pool of blood on my cheek there is a puncture wound about the size of a comb tooth, and then some.

i had stabbed the entire tooth into my cheek, then pulled the comb with such force the tooth bent back and tore my flesh into a 1/4 inch deep tear dropped shaped puncture wound. at least it's only one of many blemishes on my face, and if anything it counter balances the cat scratch on the other cheek.",i combed my beard so hard that instead of pulling out a tangle i inserted the comb into my face and still managed to follow through.

so i was in the cafeteria with a few friends and i thought it would be funny to screw with them a bit with the salt-shakers. so i started off by filling one of my friend's pockets with salt while she was speaking to one half of the group, the other half trying to contain their laughter, as they were focused on my prank. she puts her hand in her pocket at some point, hilarity ensues, blah blah blah. so, continuing the theme, i thought it would be funny to pour a bit of salt on another one of my friend's phones as she had unsuspectingly left it on the table, followed up by moderately funny salt puns and playfully mocking her about how crunchy her keys would be. again, harmless, stupid fun, easily amused friends amused easily.

later in the day, she texts me ""so you pouring salt in my phone cause the speaker to break"". fuck. so, of course i immediately tell her that i will pay for it's repair, but she tells me it would be cheaper to just replace it.

upgrade-$200
luckily she was nice enough to let me off with $50 (although, to be fair, i know a bit about hardware and i could have easily fixed it--i didn't want to come off as rude or stingy, however, so i just obliged to pay). i ended up paying her 60 because i only had 20s and i didn't ask for change as i figured i owed her a bit more than that.",i broke my friend's phone by pouring salt on it and had to dish out $60 to make up for it.

so i had a bath, blah blah blah, and when i got out i stood up too quickly and my blood pooled. due to the window being closed it was really hot and stuffy in the bathroom and i was getting less oxygen. i started losing vision and balance, and could feel my legs getting weak, but before i could sit down i fainted and on my way down i hit my head on the toilet seat (broke the seat off the hinge and got a mild concussion). when i tried to get up, i couldn't stand and stumbled again. this time i hit my leg on a cabinet and now have a very painful bruise in the same position as where my pockets sit, so now i can’t put things in my pocket without being in pain.","– i broke the toilet with my head. go on, read it. it’s funny."

update 5:34pm est: i explained what happened to the guy whom i was going to be interviewing, and the potential employer is willing to give me a phone interview due to his busy schedule. so, i may still have a chance after all.","there was a mixup in the interview time, but i don't know who made the mistake (me or employer). i don't think i'll get the job."
520,"read a lifehack on reddit before about pooping at work, and so once i started my shiny new office job i proceeded to try it out. it soon became a shameful habit that i'm trying hard to get rid of.

fast forward to today, after doing the buttclench as i waited for my supervisor to finish talking to me, i dashed to the bathroom and brought my phone with me. i got a little carried away with the fruit ninja and i ended up being there for 10 minutes before wiping and standing up to flush.

to my horror, there was a palm-sized poop streak inside the bowl, near the part that sucks the water/poo in. even the huge amounts of tp i used to wipe did not scrub it away as it flushed. i tried flushing again, but it stayed there, mocking me like the smug bastard it is. i just ran off, hoping no one saw me(although i'm p sure they heard me flush twice since it's a small office)

i'm typing this from my cube, my head hung in shame. i feel bad for the nice custodian who has to scrub it off later.",mud streaks.
521,"so lately i've been getting into trouble by writing things down that should not be written down. especially on things like tests. well today me and my friend came up with a nickname for a friend whose name is annie. the name was trannie. the name was a funny joke and she thought it was funny, but me being the person who doesn't filter before he acts decides to write in down on her mac case. now i haven't gotten in trouble from this stuff in a month or two so i've been a good boy lately. but i wrote it down in pen... now it won't come off and she seems a little pissed but who really knows, she's annie. so now she has to present something with her computer and the computer goes right in front of the teacher. as i'm typing this now the teacher is looking right at the writing and i know in dead soon or later. we'll have to see what happens next but for now my ass is hers.",i wrote trannie on a girls computer and i know i'm fucked.
522,"so i react poorly to coffee. i'm not entirely sure why, but i do. depending on the day, that reaction will range somewhere on the spectrum between fairly harmless to my very own circle of hell. unfortunately, i haven't been able to figure out why exactly my level of coffee related terribleness varies so much, do drinking coffee is usually an exciting game of digestive tract roulette. with this in mind, i very rarely drink coffee.

well, today i was itchin' for a gamble and grabbed a mocha before work. all seemed well in westeros as i sipped it slowly throughout my shift. and then it started. at first, i was simply inconveniently queasy, but i was able to get home and start making dinner without too much hassle. it wasn't until i had heated a half inch of oil that the pain really began. i went from stirring mashed potatoes and frying schnitzel to being huddled in a ball on the floor, attempting to keep my insides from becoming my outsides. somehow i was able to stand up and finish cooking before collapsing into a quivering puddle of pain on the couch. 

after taking boatloads of pain and stomach medications that my medical professional boyfriend kindly fetched me (as well as several hours of earth shattering pain), my body has finished throwing it's hissy fit. unfortunately, i was largely unable to partake in the delicious schnitzel that i prepared due to feeling like death. pretty much ruined what was planned to be a fun night with the roommate, boyfriend, and true blood. never again, coffee. never. again.",the coffee i drank crushed both my soul and digestive tract.
523,"this was actually yesterday but i was in hospital for much of the afternoon, so here you go:

my friend and i are both english teachers in a small (relatively) in china. neither of us speak particularly good chinese. just a bit of context.

so yesterday afternoon neither of us had work so we headed out for lunch, him riding an electronic bike (similar to a moped) and me on the back of it. we had a nice lunch and decided to ride into town to play some pool. we played for about an hour and a half, had 2 small bottles of beer each and decided to head back to get ready for an evening in the bar. i hopped on the back of his bike and we set off. now outside of the pool place the traffic trying to park is ridiculous, everybody diving through small gaps in motorised vehicles as soon as they appear. my friend sees one such gap between two parked cars and goes for it. the gap was big enough for him, it was even just about big enough for the bike, but it wasn't big enough for me on the back. my knee was cut open from just to the bottom right of the joint to i don't really know where. i jumped off the bike and looked down to see blood, fat, what i think was bone and then decided not to look anymore. my friend bandaged my leg with his tshirt.

one of the drivers of a nearby car hopped out and my friend shouted at him to call an ambulance (in english) and gestured with his hand as a phone. the guy pointed in the direction of a cab and we didn't know how the fuck to argue, so into the cab. the driver rushed us to the hospital, both me and my friend furiously calling people who can speak both languages and might not be in work. arriving at the hospital i was laid straight down in a first response (or whatever the word is) room and they stitched my knee up. my friend estimates 20 stitches, i have no idea.

i realised at this point i left my phone in the cab and couldn't contact anyone. me and my friend didn't share many mutual contacts so this was a bit of a problem.

we did have a chinese english speaker with us by this time and he helped out as they gave me shots, ivs and i don't know what the fuck else. i got onto the chinese twitter through my friends phone and started to message anyone who might be able to help with my follow up appointment (today). my ex-girlfriend (chinese) answered saying the taxi company had my phone and had called her (yes!!) and where was i cause she was going to come look after me (not so yes). she came over to the hospital, was sufficiently unsympathetic in alleviating any of my fear of being in a hospital where i can barely read the word for exit. after that she took me back home, promising my friends to stay with me. at about 9pm she left (i'm pretty sure to meet a guy, whatever) and promised to return at 7am this morning for my 7.30 appointment. it's now 8.20, and with no phone and very limited ability to walk i've decided to write this instead of trying to solve my problem.

so, yes.

** 

**edit:** found someone else to take me into hospital and just seen the wound for myself, more like 9 stitches. sorry for the hyperbole. pics will be delivered in 2 days if there's any interest

**edit 2:** so my ex girlfriend eventually turned up to give me my phone. i gave her the cold shoulder for her morning behavior. fast forward 4 hours and she's in my bed (which bear in mind i can't move from), drunk as a sailor puking her guts out on my floor and telling me she loves me. really fml.

**edit 3:** also bear in mind i live on a middle school campus.

so the ex passes out in my bed, i chat to her friend about how she should leave etc but the friend's very nice and passed out is better than crazy, trust me. my friend the driver shows up with snacks and a crate and the 3 of us chat for a bit. my ex's friend suddenly decides it's time to go so we wake up sleeping beauty, i tell her she should go and she absolutely freaks out. hitting me, the kneee, everything. my driver friend decides this is sufficiently dangerous to haul her off me and physical get her out the room. a 5 minute standoff ensues with her trying to knock down my door, biting a chunk outta my friend's finger and the other teachers having to come down to try and make her leave. eventually security was called, she left calmly and we've given her picture to security to ensure she can't get back into the gates. and the driver's gone back to hospital for a course of antibiotics.

**tldr 2:** we done fucked up son

**will provide pics of all of this if someone can give me a place to image host other than imgur, which is to all intents and purposes blocked in china**

524,"no, the title is not sarcasm.

i had a tough quiz today, and i did well. so i decided to treat myself to some taco bell, as i haven't had any in ages. i figured i'd be spending the night in, studying for my upcoming midterms anyway, so it didn't matter if i got the taco bell shits.

i ordered a bunch of bean burritos and fucking demolished them. i figured even if it's the horrifying meat that makes redditors shit like they have cholera, the beans would at least give me some wicked farts.

so, i waited a few hours, with no gastrointestinal distress. i received a text from a good friend i haven't seen in a while, asking if i wanted to have some girl time. i declined with the excuse that i had to study. she implored me again, and a second time i declined, certain i was making the responsible decision.

still, my intestines and colon remained calm. i didn't even let a single one rip. my stomach was placid as fuck, i took a normal dump, and slowly my rage grew. nothing. i would've been fine to meet up with her.","i turned down seeing a friend who i won't for a while because i thought i'd get the runs, but nothing happened, so i stayed in for no fucking reason."
525,"(this was a couple months ago but i just found this sub-reddit and wanted to share.)

i came back home to visit my friends and family from being stationed in europe for a year. the family threw a welcome back party for me and invited relatives and friends over for food and drinks. living in europe had inspired me to be more ""fashion forward"" and more aware of new stylish clothing. i bought my very first pair of grey skinny jeans just for the trip home to show off my new sense of style. 

the party was fun and and everyone was impressed with my new look. shots of tequila and mixed drinks were beginning to take a toll on me as my family were making sure i had a good time. i was stumbling and slurring my words around my family and went to the bathroom to take a piss.

i was very drunk and still not used to skinny jeans. i really had to pee and i couldn't get my member out and through the short zipper of the pants. i lost my bladder and pissed my pants. my wife came in to find me with a distressed look on my face. ""what the fuck do i do?!"" then my entire family came in to see what was wrong. 

in the end, my younger brother lent me some basketball shorts and i blacked out in my little sister's bed as my wife tried to change my clothes. in the morning, i left the house hungover with my skinny pee pants in a bag before anyone woke up. now i wear skinny jeans with caution.",i got drunk and pissed my pants in front of my family because i wore skinny jeans for the first time.
526,"my housemate and i are also coursemates at uni, and sometimes i'll cook for both of us (no homo) in return for him tutoring me. i was making pork chops with mash potatoes. spuds are done so i go to mash them and they need a little milk to soften... get the milk from the fridge, check the best before (was 2 days within use by date) and pour some in the pan.

it was off.

not like slightly off either, i'm talking lumpy, vomit inducing yoghurt ruining my hard efforts. managed to scoop all the bad stuff out but broke the masher in anger (yes we ate them still, we're hungry students). so i'm stood there over the sink, rinsing what is left in the pan to ensure its edible, wondering how i'm going to mash them now i've broken the utensil designed specifically for this job when i decided it would be just as will to crush them in my hands. 

little did i know that while they may be cold on the outside, they were still near boiling temperatures on the inside. this was to be soon known all too well not just to my poor scolded fingers but also to the rest of our friends who heard me scream from the other end of the house.","idiot pours off milk into mash, breaks potato masher, burns hand attempting to squeeze spuds."
527,"earlier today i was trying to get to my car, which was on the other side of a navel-high fence. of course, in my divine wisdom, i decided to try and step over the fence rather than jumping over, or (better yet), walking the extra 20 yards around the fence. i planted one foot on the bottom rung, and just as i swept my other leg over to straddle the fence, the first foot sliped off (because icy fence) and my entire body weight suddenly slamed down onto the pointed fence via my crotch. 

i pierced my pants in two placed, stabbed my sack, my taint, and my butthole as i instinctually rolled backwards to alleviate the pressure on my body. fortunately for me, the fence was just high enough so that i couldn't reach the ground with my feet. the fence nearly went up my butt and actually gave me some really nice gouges near my anus. i nearly passed out from the pain, but luckily i didn't tear the sack.

528,"so today my mother was in a mood. a certain mood i know well, a mood that drives her to clean. so after deciding my room as her target, she begins to tear in with me by her side. she was going full honey badger, digging through everything, but i believed i had nothing to hide. then, turning away from a pile i was sorting, i see her leaning over my bed, picking up the one dark item in my room. 
there, in my sweet mothers hand was a crusty, smelly sock that i had been fapping into for nearly a month. my vision darkened as i waited for my doom. my sweet, angelic mother looked upon the sock, and said, ""something smells..."" then, she did the worst act i have ever witnessed. not realizing what it was, she took my smelly, crisp cum sock and took a nice deep whif. a deep sniff that stabbed into my soul like a knife. i calmly took it from her hands, and set it in the laundry basket. she still did not know, but that almost made it worse. tifu...

529,"sorry for wall of text, i typed this on my ipod. though this happened around three weeks ago, i'll believe this is probably one of my dumbest fuck ups i had ever made. there were only a few days left of my strength training class before first semester ended so my teacher had decided to have the class play a game of kickball rather than lifting. in this game of kickball there were only two bases: home and the wall on the opposite side of the gym. to score all you had to do was kick the ball and run from home to second base (the opposite wall), and back and not get hit with the ball. pretty simple and easy right? the game was going fine, my team was in the lead and it was finally my turn to kick again. my previous kick had caused the team to get an out so i felt that couldn't screw up this time. i kick the ball and i run at a full sprint towards second base. i was going fast, no one was gonna get me out. finally i'm approaching the wall (second base) and i think of the greatest idea at the time. to stop my fast ass i'll just stick my foot in front of me and pivot off the wall and run back to home. full speed ahead! i stick my foot infront of me and hit the wall. crack!!! the everyone goes silent as the loud snap of the bone in my leg echoes through the gym. there i lay in shame on the cold hard floor screaming all kinds of curses. my class surrounds me as i flail around in pain till my african-american friend, who i presumed told everyone to move out the way to help me up, looks me dead in the eye and says, ""you're stupid."" finally my teacher comes running over, looks at my leg and says ""holy shit!"" now i lay here on my couch in a long leg cast with a broken tibia and fibula wondering where in life did i go wrong? at least i didn't shit my pants.","playing kickball in pe, i spartan kick a wall and break my leg."
530,"first things first: i keep good hygiene. i try to be clean, and like things to be clean. that being said, i take ass-washing seriously. i keep my ass clean, and wipe thoroughly.

earlier this morning, i had to take a monster dump. it felt like i hadn't crapped in days. i had to drop a giant load, and nothing was going to stop me from doing so. i get to school, and immediately headed straight to the restroom. when i arrived, the restroom was cleared. it seemed this crap was destined by the gods, for while i dominated the toilet, no one came in (this could also be from my furious shitting, but either works). the shit was immaculate, and i felt so much lighter afterwards. i went to wipe, and in my favor, the paper was stainless. so much so, i felt i could set it out for the next person. however, i was suspicious, and i made sure to wipe a few extra times to be sure this was a perfect poop. indeed it was, since all others were stainless as well.

fast forward to 2nd period (the bell schedule is set in our high school for 4 periods, each an hour and a half long), my ass starts to itch. the thought never occurred to me as too odd, so i dismissed it and moved on. about 30 minutes later, my ass really itches, and i've got a bad wedgie going on with it. i started to feel worried, and i waited for the bell to ring to proceed to 3rd period. the walk was long and awkward, and when i got there, it started to smell. bad. i realized that i had to check it out at this point, and left to use the restroom. i get at the stall and check why my ass had itched so badly.

a huge skidmark was left on the back of my boxers. it was dark and thick, almost like my ass had painted me a picture of a log with chocolate syrup. completely taken back, i go to wipe. i could have made half a turd with what was on those toilet papers. i felt completely embarrassed and betrayed, and the smell was horrid. i couldn't go back into class with this, so i improvised. i decided to take a couple sheets of toilet paper, and put them on the spots where there was skid left. 

this plan had worked, until i felt the classroom start to get really hot. i was wearing a heavy coat to add insult to injury, so i was sweating bullets for *two* reasons now. class had just ended, so i got up hurriedly, and left. however, something was fatally wrong. i didn't feel the toilet paper, and instead felt a small collection of dingle berries fall down my leg and into my shoe. apparently, sweating with sticky shit and shuffling around in your desk breeds the fuckers. i saw my girlfriend, and completely power-walked past her to get to the restroom to empty my shoe. i counted at least 5 brown, thick dingle berries fall right out of my shoe. i couldn't live with myself the rest of the day, so i stayed put in 4th period until i got home.",shits can be deceiving.
531,"so this was actually last september, but i thought it's a good story to tell for my first reddit post!

i live on the west coast of canada, so in my province the legal drinking age is 19. naturally, on my 19th birthday, my girlfriends and i head out to a classy restaurant with a bar vibe, since some of them were still underage and couldn't go to a bar or club. anyways, drinking shenanigans obviously ensue. i'm a small (5'2) girl, and was never much of a heavy drinker, so by the 2nd bellini and 2nd shot, i'm good and hammered. we head back to my best girlfriends house to dance, and a huge glass of wine,a shot and a beer are consumed. at this point i'm the most sloshed i've ever been, and throwing up over her deck. my best friends boyfriend hauls me over to the toilet, i actually pee on him while i puke, and they put me to bed. 

the morning rolls around, and i have a quiz at school (university) that i'll be damned if i miss, hungover and miserable as i am. i drag my sorry ass out of bed, shower, dress, consume a large glass of water and tylenol, and promptly puke them back up again. i make tea, sip it, and throw up yet again. i'm running late, so i grab a water bottle and head to the car. it's a half hour drive to school, so i fight the waves of nausea while sitting in traffic. i swung by a tim hortons drive thru to grab a bagel and more tea, feeling very ill at this point, but i don't want to be late so i keep driving despite the overwhelming nausea. i can feel my diaphragm heaving, and finally pull off into a home depot parking lot, and just before opening my door, spray vomit everywhere. 

having no other clothes, i then had to clean myself off with a paper napkin, and proceeded to drive to school, and write a quiz in puke-covered jeans. needless to say no one would sit near me...the smell of vomit lingered in my car for about a month despite a thorough cleaning and air fresheners.","went over board on the drinking, peed on my friends bf, puked all over self and car, had to go to school covered in vomit."
532,"i am from the united states but i am studying in florence for the semester. on my spring break i just traveled around italy by train. as i was getting ready to leave naples i went to the train station to get a ticket from one of the self service machines.

i was not there for 10 seconds when a man walks up to me and asks if i speak italian. i speak a little so he starts talked very loudly to me about this thing. he goes through the menu of the machine and enters a special code and gets my ticket for 10 euro instead of 68. he then demands that i pay him part of the difference because he saved me a bunch of money. i gave him like 35 euro which was all the cash i had with me.

the next day on the train when they ask me for the ticket. after a quick look they ask for a eurail pass. and i'm like, shit. i don't have one. so they take my money. i was fined 50 euro and had to pay for a new ticket.","got conned at a train station, ended up spending 163 euro for a train rather than just 68 for the ticket."
533,"**wow, guys. fuck up of the week! i was not expecting such a response. thanks for all the comments and support!**

this actually happened a few weeks ago, but i've just learned today of the unfortunate outcome to my actions.

my friend's mother asked me to drive her to phoenix to pick some furniture up from her friend bill's house, as i am the only one in our group with a truck. i agreed, and off we went.

upon arrival, and after the opening pleasantries, i was left to my own devices while the two catch up. after cracking open a beer, offered by bill before they disappeared into the other room, i discovered bill's shopping list stuck to his fridge. there were 4 or 5 items already written (i don't remember what), and i took it upon myself to add one, like i do. i found a sharpee, and added ""50 lbs monkey chow.""

now, i knew beforehand, and confirmed via sight upon arrival, that bill is disabled. it never occurred to me that he would have someone do his house cleaning and shopping for him. anita arrived the following day, let herself in, grabbed the list, and did her job. never once did she question the curious addition that was so obviously written in someone else's hand. she drove and searched for *hours* before finally finding an outlet that carried bulk quantities of exotic pet food *fifty god damned miles away*, and you bet your ass she bought it and brought it home to her employer, pleased as punch. 

naturally, bill was furious. he thought it was one of his friends from out of state that was visiting a few weeks earlier, messing with him, and called my friend's mother to complain. he was so mad, he fired her on the spot, and now i feel just awful. 

i truly can't stop laughing, but i do feel really, really bad.

edit: i should have included that after hearing about this, i did call and own up to it. i explained everything, and suggested he hire her back, although i'm not so sure he will. the reimbursement check goes in the mail tomorrow.

second edit: as it turns out, he did hire her back, and now keeps his shopping list hidden until shopping day.

*courtesy of /u/mcelite:*","op jokingly added ""50 lbs monkey chow."" to the shopping list of a disabled friend of a relatives. said person did not do his own shopping and monkey chow was eventually found, bought, and people were fired.**"
534,"yeah. so there we were.. half drunk, doin the ol' in and out. i felt like a pornstar, throwing dick like a mad man. she seems to be enjoying herself. i am having the time of my life. she asks me to bust on her tits, so when the time comes i gladly give her what she wants. now, i don't know about the rest of you guys, but when i bust a great one, i have a hard time thinking straight for a few minutes. might as well be asleep for all i can accomplish. so when she asks my retarded ass to hand her a cum rag i reach down and grab whatever the hell i can on the floor and tossed it to her. that's not exactly right. i was actually on the up swing with the first soft thing i felt on the floor when the supposed wadded shirt decided to explode into her pissed off poodle. in my post-orgasm stupidity i sling the seemingly rabid goddamn poodle at her at the speed of light. this gremlin in disguise smashes into her face with the force of a mike tyson punch. the demon dog is none too happy about this as you can imagine. hellhound decides since i have commenced evasive action while screaming my viking warcry he will take out his frustration on the next closest individual. you guessed it, the poor gf, who is currently disoriented and trying to figure out what the fuck has smashed into her face and why i am hollering like like i just zipped up my penis while simultaneously setting it on fire in a vice. the t-rex masquerading as a dog then bites the shit out of her recently broken nose. (i assume the initial impact broke it but there's no way i'm admitting that to her.) she then screams her amazon battle scream and slings shit head the dog down the hallway. so there i was, holding my pillow of death up like a shield while she punched the shit out of me til i manages to stop laughing (i know, i'm evil) long enough to explain to her why her nose is bleeding like hell. knock knock on the door. i discover my kind neighbor has called the cops after she heard our battle cries. so there i am, standing the hallway of my apartment building wearing a bathrobe covered in blood. laughing maniacally at how stupid this is going to sound. thankfully they split us up an my gf didn't lie and told them the exact same story i did they and they let us be. i swear those cops probably pissed themselves laughing at that one. for fucks sake man. 

edit: holy shit front page! thanks! guess i will share a few more events in the near future :)

535,"so i slept on the couch last night because a friend stayed over. i'd woken up first and wanted to watch some freaks and geeks, so i went upstairs to grab a pair of headphone so i wouldn't wake anyone up with the volume, because it was dark i accidentally plugged the headphones adapter into the usb heard and saw sparks and short circuited my laptop ....",i short circuited my laptop by plugging headphones into the usb port.
536,"it was late at night and only my daughter and myself were awake. i was letting her stay up and watch shows on the roku in the living room. i got her interested in a classic that i watched when i was a kid, where the red fern grows. 

now, there are a few important points:

-i was using a smartphone app as a remote control for the roku. it connects to the device via wifi. 

-the roku app has an option of streaming photographs from the phone to the television. you're always two clicks away from this option. the button for this option is right next to the button for the on-screen keyboard.

-i had food on my hands, so my daughter was controlling the phone.

i was trying to help her search for the show, and i reached down with my pinky to press the keyboard button for her. i pressed the wrong button. somehow, by the gods that organize photos on cell phones, two pictures popped up on the phone. my husband's face and his dick, with matching red hair. in the dick pic it was pointing toward the camera, like something you might expect to come with 3d glasses. and the one that popped up on the television was the dick. 

fuck.

she covered her face and gave me a stern, ""mooooooommmm!"" i was so embarrassed that i immediately told my brother in-law and woke up my husband to tell him.

honestly, it was hilarious, but i still feel bad.","showed my daughter her stepfather's dick in stunning 3d hd, on a 50 inch led television."
537,"the lights were off in my room after playing a game of league of legends with my friends, last night. after losing (it was close), i told my pals that i'd be calling it for the night. some agreed, some stayed online - yet, i knew that my schedule for the rest of the night included two things.

i found myself masturbating at roughly 2:00 am. knowing that i'd be getting up at 7:00 am, i rushed off to sleep, shortly after brushing my teeth and washing my face until it was as smooth as a baby's bottom. fast forward to this morning. i pahked my cah in my normal spot in the garage. coincidentally, one of my employer's co-council parked right next to me as i was walking to the elevator. we talked about guitar and dave matthews in the elevator, and then he split to grab a coffee before heading into the office. i headed towards the office, so i could get my workspace set up. i walked through the automatic sliding doors, bid hello to my girl, the down to earth security lady at the front desk, and then made my way to the second floor via the stairs, making a b-line to the bathroom for a quick number one before work.

after thoroughly washing my hands, i left the bathroom, punched the code into my office's keypad, and walked inside. i said hello to a few lawyers that work in my office, and headed to my area - a big conference room where i am working temporarily. i plugged in both my power supply and ethernet cord to the wall, and then placed my laptop on the table. i attached said cords, and popped the lid of my lenovo laptop open.

what i had forgotten, was the haste in which i headed to bed last night. when i opened up my laptop, kagney linn carter was on the verge of bursting her vocal cords while getting ""missionarily"" pummeled by some random, large-dicked male. he was really handing it to her, i mean, really, giving her the business. my speakers were about 75%, and it was very loud and clear. i think she was moaning about how big his dick was, and how much she liked big dicks. she also may have been proclaiming how she was near orgasm. i quickly went for the mute hotkey on my keyboard, and then started rustling around in some papers while i popped on a soft pandora channel.

luckily, not too many of my coworkers are here yet. one paralegal came into my ""office"" and asked me when the hobbit was coming out, with a relatively straight face. i informed him it was a few weeks ago, and we shared a high five. he didn't even mention the porn. phew.",i opened my laptop at work with porno blasting on the speakers.
538,"my dad had to pay some bills and he asked to use my laptop, i happily obliged, opened my laptop and there, full screen was porn. gay porn. this really isn't a big deal because i am out, but it was really embarrassing and all i could do was slam my laptop shut, turn beat red and laugh. my dad none the less had a quite different reaction, i guess parents like to pretend their kids never get off, or have access to porn...","i let my dad use my laptop, opened it up to a man with another mans dick up his ass."
539,"so there i was, halfway through my movie (in the basement alone) when i felt the urge that our ancestors have felt for the last few millennia. it was a good movie though, and i'm lazy so i didn't feel like pausing it. ""just 10 more minutes"" i thought to myself. long story short, i held it for a long time and then decided i would be bad ass and hold it until the ending credits, at which point i would sprint upstairs and give my bladder a break. 

woohoo! bad guy in jail! movie's don...

oh. there's an epilogue. 

well, i did say i would wait until the ending credits started.

this is a fucking long epilogue...

i reeeeeeeally have to go...

""but those are the best kind..."" (ending line)

*sprints up stairs, down the hall*

aaaaand... younger sister is washing hands.

hold it a little longer (it's starting to squirt out a little bit)

sister comes out, i go in, start with my buckle and..

i piss myself right in front of the fucking toilet. get it all over my new (today) boots. 

i laugh, grab a towel, mop it up (i have no idea what i drank today, but it was a lot) 

cover my jeans with a blanket, make my excuses to my mother, run to my shower, and get in the water, clothes and all. 

my excuse for the wet clothing was ""i forgot to undress.""

i'm already laughing about it.",i wet myself for the first time in a decade (i'm in my senior year of hs)
540,"so i was just stroking the ol' sausage today when in a horny stupor i decided to find out what it felt like to cum on my face.  i figured if so many pornstars do it then it couldn't be that bad right? wrong.  it got all over my eyes and burned like a motherfucker.  now my eyes are red, hurt like hell, and my eyelashes are encrusted with semen.  every time i blink i feel the throbbing shame.  never again.

 


edit: wow, a lot of people know how it feels apparently.  my eyes are back to normal now for anyone concerned.  but the shame is still there.  it will always be there.",my eyes might be pregnant.  will report back in 9 months.
541,"(21/m) it was a standard wednesday night, just got home from work and was flopping around until the gf decides that it would be a good idea to go to a bar. ok, sure, but i have to be back early since i have work again the next day; immediately upon arrival i began the beer sprints and managed to kill about 10 in an hour. at this point, i'm pretty drunk and completely disregard time, i vaguely remember leaving and after that everything is gone. when i spoke to the gf the next day she said she came in and we got our cuddle on and then she left me asleep in my bed....and then i spoke to my mom. apparently, throughout the course of the night, i unleashed the full force of my pale hairy body and climbed into bed with my dad. he was awoken by the clumsy attempt to get comfortable, and proceeded to ask me what the actual fuck i was doing and ordered me to go to bed, to which i replied, ""i am nigger."" multiple times.","got schwasted, climbed into bed with dad naked, called that man a nigger for trying to disturb my slumber"
542,"today, i did a time trial on a bicycle. it's a race against the clock, no drafting other people, go at your own pace by yourself. there is a 1 minute gap between every rider at the start, so to catch someone your time would have to be 1 minute faster than theirs. really simple, and *really* embarrassing to fuck up. the course is an idyllic 10 km (6 mile) seaside loop, around which you do 2 laps. mostly very close to flat, except for one short uphill section. i was feeling good, and i wanted to keep my average speed above 40 km/h (25 mph). 

halfway through and starting my second lap i was feeling really good, my speed was hovering around 41 and i was pretty comfortable, relaxed and ready to pick up the pace towards the end. as i hit the bottom of the short incline i focused on not slowing down too much. coming over the top of the incline i focused on getting myself back up to speed. i was just about to settle back into my pace when all of a sudden i was on my back, in a ditch, my own bike at my left and a toppled tricycle on my right. 

i was shocked at myself and i didn't know what to do, so i gingerly righted her trike. she didn't say anything, and all i could say was ""sorry, oh my god, oh my god, oh my sorry!"" over and over again. it all happened so quickly, but fortunately our injuries were limited to mild road rash. unfortunately, the  brand new, team issue, two hundred dollar skinsuit i was wearing at the time became garbage all at once. it was the single most disheartening moment of my life, and it honestly took all of my resolve not to cry out of pure disapointment in myself.

it turns out, she was actually a gold-medal paralympian in women's paraplegic road racing. a racing model handcycle like hers is worth at least eight thousand dollars, fortunately nobodies cycles got hurt. and once i got over the initial feeling of just pure desire to cease existing because what i had done i felt fine.",i didn't look where i was going.
543,"my mom wakes me up today and says that someone is here to talk to me. [i am just like](http://i.imgur.com/elpcotw.gif). i go out to the living room and a teacher from my old elementary is sitting there (my mother works at that elementary).

""mr. d is here to talk to you about being gay,"" says my mother.

[what the fuck!?!?](http://i.imgur.com/8lv7uou.gif)

[i just stand there...](http://i.imgur.com/ai3cglt.gif) [""uhm.. i don't understand what's going on.""](http://i.imgur.com/2wnkhaz.gif) i feel moderately embarrassed and extremely confused.

the teacher is gay, he is probably the only gay person my mom knows, so that's why he was called. he asks if i would rather talk with him alone about this kind of thing. we head outside to the deck and my mom waits inside.

""your mom called me last night because she thinks i am well equipped to handle this situation."" he begins.

""i think that there may have been some sort of misunderstanding."" i think i begin to grasp what's going on here.

he explains the situation about how the other night when i spoke with my mom and i came out to her. he says i came out to her when i told her that my favourite song is ""same love"" by macklemore, i had her listen to it. my mother and i began to talk, that night, about gay rights and about how passionate i am when it comes to that sort of thing. (she is extremely religious and i an atheist)

to end it he says this, ""your mother has always thought you were gay and figured you were finally coming out of the closet.""

[for awhile i just stand there](http://i.imgur.com/fuxkmoh.gif)

she thought that the only way i would be so interested in that kind of thing is if i were gay myself. she took my explanation about my passion for gay rights as ""i am gay"".

he finally asks the question, ""are you gay?""

i may have a weird sense of humor because i started to find the situation kind of entertaining, i reply ""[no.](http://i.imgur.com/blfkqsr.gif)""

i feel slightly terrible because i have just wasted this guys time.

okay, now for the worst part, she had told several people and most of my family about the situation. she never even directly asked me if i was gay. she said that it was pretty clear i came out of the closet when i said ""same love"" is a good song.

[inside me](http://i.imgur.com/qrtpibx.gif)

i stayed calm the whole time. she never apologized for what happened or even said anything about it after mr. d left.","i told my mom ""same love"" is a good song, she assumes i am homosexual"
544,"technically speaking this happened on monday, but it gets better. well, worse in my case. this is all for your entertainment.

monday i went to the beach with some friends. totally normal day at the beach. everything was chill and and as expected. i, personally, hate going into the water. the idea of bacteria and fishy fecal matter makes me cringe. that and local pools (although there is chlorine, i still don't care). *anyways.*

i was wearing a muscle shirt and brought my sand chair. i **loathe** the idea of wearing sunscreen. the texture and smell of it make me nauseous. lotion, too. so, i got up every so often just to stretch and walk the beach to maybe try and avoid being fried. it worked mildly. i continued watching my friends gallop in the shit infested ocean and swallow pints of salty fish droppings. we spent about 3 hours there.

i got this really nice sunburn. my skin was pretty tight and red. i thought, ""meh. it's just sunburn. it will go away and [i can go back to normal living.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdf5n-zi14)""

i enjoy the rest of the day with my friends. dinner, road trip, then home. shower. sleep. done.

i wake up and my arms are littered in blisters, they are radiating intense heat, and are so bright red you could direct traffic with them. the tops of my feet were burnt a little and my right foot's skin is so tight that whenever i take a step, blood pressure builds in my foot, and pushes against my skin causing unfathomable pain.

today is day 3 of said burnt skin. i will be missing about 4 days of work and approximately $177.67 worth of payment. oh, and, i lied to my employer thinking that they wouldn't accept sunburn as an appropriate excuse. i said that, ""i have a decent laceration on my upper left leg when i fell in the ocean. i am headed to the emergency room to get stitches."" now i need a doctor's note upon my return. a doctor's visit is $75. i have no health insurance. i thought, ""ok. appropriate, i suppose. these burns look serious.""

to the doctor i drove. it was a walk in clinic. it was confirmed that i had 2^nd degree burns and i was prescribed a cream (silver sulfadiazine).",i am in the hole of $282.67 due to work missed and a doctor's appointment (doctor's excuse required upon return) because i couldn't put on some *motherfucking sunscreen.*
545,"i was listening to this new song [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bf-8uc07pu). then my mom walked in and i accidentally clicked on [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz5eyf0f9pu) of a girl shaking her butt to a song because i jumped when she opened the door. then to make matters worse i tried to click away from it real quick and told my mom [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64v_sjd3rhk) was the one i was watching and accidentally clicked the wrong video again (another hot booty shaking video)! now my mom thinks i have some kind of sick butt fetish, and she wont look me in the eye. what should i do redditors? she wont beleive me it was an accident. although the girls have some very nice bottoms to say the least i can't stand my mom thinking i'm a freak!",my mom thinks i have a butt fetish because of a couple of accidents and now wont talk to me the same way.
546,"i was at a school competition today, and my mom brought me a peanut butter and banana sandwich. problem is, we had bottles of chocolate milk at home, but my mom only had orange juice.the chocolate milk/peanut butter combo i had been looking forward to was now out of my reach. accepting the orange juice, i decided to eat my sandwich.
tragedy struck.
after a few bites, i felt a sour taste on my tongue. i kept eating, and then i realized that you shouldn't have peanut butter and orange juice. 
i spent the next half hour feeling like i was going to throw up, and when i got home took a horrible shit. worst thing i've eaten in awhile.",": don't mix peanut butter, orange juice and a banana."
547,"sleeping off headaches is not the greatest of ideas.
okay so this is the first week of school, i've been under a lot of stress lately because of it and it doesn't help that i've had my time of the month recently. i woke up this morning about 1 am, my head pounding furiously like the beating of drums.
i was in complete excruciating pain, so i crawled my way over to my parent's room and woke my mom up, because she has gigantic elephant strength ibuprofen pills. that, and i was so completely blinded by pain that i could barely move, walk or talk. laying down made the pain worse. mom woke up, she kinda panicked because i was crying and sobbing and had my hands over my eyes because the light she turned on hurt like a bitch. she managed to get me downstairs, sat me down in our reclining chair and got me to take an ibuprofen. a cold washcloth over my eyes and a barf bucket completed the ensemble of migraine. and, unfortunately, i always barf when i have migraines. that pill didn't quite last long in my stomach. lo and behold, i upchuck acid and other shit, and like magic some of that shit *came out my nose*. after that i just kinda fell asleep in the chair and i don't remember anything else after that.",i got the worst migraine imaginable and killed my nasal cavity with stomach acid.
548,"earlier, i had just taken a drink of cola when a coworker said something funny that caused another coworker to spit out the water she was drinking all over her desk.
   
  this caused me to laugh and made me nearly spit my own beverage out all over *my* desk. luckily, i had an empty coffee cup handy, so i spit into that instead of trying to swallow it and having it shoot out of my nose.  
   
  shortly afterwards, i had to leave my desk for a while. when i came back, i noticed that i still had some coffee in my cup and figured i'd finish it before going to wash my cup.  
   
  i thought it tasted a bit odd and it took a minute for it to register that i had just drank my own spit. yay me.","coffee? nope, spit and coke zero."
549,"i have lurked this subrreddit for a while snd thought i would never join the ranks but today my day has come. so i have been dating this girl for a few months and i thought it was time to trim the bush,  so to speak. i also recently moved out of home, but when i was living there i did the trimming with scissors (sense an issue yet?) and a razor to polish it off. 

i needed a pair of scissors and the only options at the supermarket were $9 super dooper ones or childs ones for $3. kids it is. got home and started to remove hair as normal,  but started to rush as i have to go somewhere tonight. then suddenly a shock of pain shot through me, and i look down to find i have cut my ballsack along that ridge bit between the two halves. it's stopped bleeding now so i finished the rest as best i could. hopefully sex tonight isnt too painful :/",should upgrade my pube cutting tools.
550,"my ex and i were together for a year, and we got really serious. we've been broken up for a couple of months, and we've been trying to be friends to avoid any more drama. he and his friend came over to my apartment for a few drinks, and they came over already drunk. soon, my ex collapsed on my bed, and his friend soon after.

i managed to get his friend to sleep on a mattress on the floor, and i tried to get my ex to get up and sleep next to his friend. he refused, saying he wanted to sleep in my bed.

soon enough we were making out, and we got...handsy with each other. while his friend was in the same room. and i didn't think to check if his friend had indeed passed out.

he was thinking that we could be friends with benefits, and i had been thinking the same thing. but he's been crushing on this other girl, who likes him as well. he told me that he wasn't really pursuing a relationship with her, but i have my doubts. so i don't know where we're going to go from here. his friend caught us that next morning sleeping next to each other, and i don't know if he told that other girl.

so now i think that by trying not to create more drama, i just caused a bit more of it than i can handle.",almost slept with my ex; i think the girl who likes him found out about it.
551,"i woke up this morning feeling nonchalant, with the assumption that my day was going to be uneventful and boring. little did i know my  small decision at lunch was going to have the flames of hell all up in my anus and a very, very, painful bathroom experience.

i recently just finished my summer class and have been waking up pretty late, usually around 9-10am. so i do some chores and skip breakfast. at around 2pm i am feeling very hungry and look through the kitchen for some grub. i had the choice of frozen pizza, pb & j, or mac and cheese. the college lifestyle. anyway, i opted for the frozen pizza. as i'm waiting for the 20mins to pass i flip on ""the doctors"" on abc, and i get educated on how birth control may affect your choice in men. interesting concepts but not really useful to me, as i am a straight male, nevertheless now i know which guy i would go for on birth control.

the alarm goes off on the oven and i'm starving at this point. i'm ready to devour this pizza and make it my bitch. first though, i need my pepper flakes to give the pizza that zesty flare, or about as much as you can do with frozen pizza. i have three slices and put a good amount of pepper flakes on two of the slices. but then i think, ""i'm feeling pretty badass why not put flakes on all three slices!"" #yolo. little did i know my daredevil decision would leave my butthole in agony. 

fast forward some hours and you all can guess what pizza for brunch will do to you. put you on the toilet. luckily i didn't shit my pants like everyone else. as i'm on the toilet i can tell its going to be bad, my anus is already clenching for the pain that was about to strike. these pepper flakes did not breakdown while being digested. instead they ended up rubbing against the sides of my anus. i felt like someone was shoving a chili pepper up my ass. but passing it through my anus was not the worst part. it was the wiping! my butt felt sore and  on fire, i think if i farted a flame would shoot out, i imagine i got a  taste of what women go through in labor. at this point my butt feels paralyzed with pain and i don't even want to even touch it. but i couldn't leave it un-wiped though, that's disgusting. so i wipe and it felt like rubbing sandpaper against me soft butt skin. i'm pretty sure i was violated by crushed pepper flakes.  

somehow i managed to man-up and wipe my anus clean. my butt and i are doing fine now, but still have a little pain recoil from this near death experience. care to anyone reading this, don't put to much crushed pepper flakes on your food.","put to much crushed pepper flakes on pizza and ended up having my anus feel like it was on fire, and wiping felt like i was using sandpaper."
552,"so, i've recently been having random bouts of sleepwalking. at least i think that's what it is. i've never had problems with it, though i am a restless sleeper. it's happened three or four times in the past six months or so and usually i will gradually wake up while doing some arbitrary things like emptying trash bins or washing my hands in the kitchen. 

i gain consciousness slowly and, for a while, what i'm doing makes total sense. like, why wouldn't i be emptying trash bins at 3 a.m. when i was just sleeping and should still be sleeping. then, as i come to, i am usually confused and don't remember what i was doing before or why i was suddenly compelled to do so. it's been mostly harmless so far, so i don't think anything of it and go back to sleep. i have no clue what is causing it and there doesn't seem to be anything that sets it off. 

anyway, i'm out of town for work for a couple weeks and i'm staying at a hotel. i don't remember what my dream was, but i remember the feeling that there was something out in the hall that i needed to check on. i sleep in my underwear and no shirt usually, but i remember my sleep-self thinking that i was only going to go check on whatever it was that i needed to since it would be quick and so i wouldn't have to bother putting pants on. you can see where this is going. i wake up as my room door shuts behind me with a thud and, of course, sleep-me didn't have the foresight to grab my room keycard. this is odd since when i'm awake i'm always paranoid that i'll forget my keycard and double-check that it's in my pocket every time i leave the room. 

so, it's 1 a.m., i'm wearing nothing but a pair boxer-briefs, and i'm locked out of my room. i have to walk down to the front and there are multiple buildings so i use the phone in the front to call the front office, had to explain to her that i could not walk 100 feet across the courtyard to get a new card, because i was not wearing pants, and wait awkwardly in the entrance, praying that nobody else walked up. i also at this point was still in a state of confusion about my actions, so i didn't even really realize that i had sleepwalked again. thus, i have no explanation as to *why* i am locked out of my room with no pants on in the middle of the night. regardless, the lady at the front desk brought me my key and i went back to sleep, still confused as to what exactly happened.

 

p.s. if the nice, non-judgmental woman who works at the residence inn in slc happens to be a redditor, i apologize for my lack of modesty and thanks for helping me out.","after sleepwalking, woke up pantsless, locked out of my hotel room.**"
553,"sitting at a light, (the light is green and i'm waiting to turn left as cars pass by) i look up into my rear view mirror to see a jeep coming in pretty fast and wouldn't you know it, a screech, then a small slam as my car lurches forward. fast forward about 2 minutes and we both pull over to inspect the damage, after asking if she is okay i look at my rear bumper to see if there is any damage, and seeing as my car isn't in the best shape to begin with, i can't tell if there is honestly any new scratches or dings, so that's good news. i go over to the ladies car to see her bumper slightly off-set, but other than, in fine shape. i ask the lady again if her and her daughter are okay, she apologizes once again, and we part ways. 

this was 3 days ago, i hadn't driven the car very much at all between today and the accident but today i woke up to go to a friends house and began to back down my driveway, when my car makes an awful, just absolutely horrible screeching and grinding sound before i shut it off and leave it in the driveway. i later power through the noise and take it to a local mechanic. after about an hour of waiting, they inform me that i have about $2000 dollars worth of repairs to be done on my car. now lets keep in mind that my car is only worth 4-5k so this is a lot to a prospective college student. i am baffled as he rattles off the list of problems to me (also i would like to add that i had it taken in a month or two earlier and it had no problems other than needing the tires rotated.) now i need to fix my transmission, alignment, sway bar, and a variety of other small fixes for which i do not have the money for, all because i didn't think it was necessary to get the ladies insurance information after the accident and now my college bound budget is paying the price.

 

moral of the story: always get the other drivers insurance information, no matter how small the accident, because it could end up saving you lots and lots of money and time in the future.","got in an accident, car looked fine, didn't get ladies insurance info, 3 days later, car needs $2000+ dollars worth of repairs."
554,"this wasn't actually today, couple of years back (17 at the time). but still, i feel you should all know and laugh!

so... i all begins with going to a friends party (hawaiian) where a lot of friends were going as well. as i was underage i couldn't go to the shop and buy some beer so i had to scout around the house to find some sufficient alcohol. i stumble upon an un-opened liter bottle of jd. jackpot!

so i meet with friends to get the bus, her family had put on a minibus 'cause they live in the middle of fucking no where! by the time the bus had arrived, i had already consumed a good 1/4 of the bottle. feeling a little drunk already.

fast forward a few hours. we're at the party, having a grand time. i'm about 2/3rd of the bottle down and getting bored of the jd. scouting around the party i find an un-opened crate, to which me and friends quickly consume. 

fast forward another few hours. time to fuck off home. i've finished the bottle of jd and a good 8/10 cans. i somehow had brought an inflatable palm tree on the bus with me. so we set off home, taking the piss out of each other and what not when my friend decides it'd be a good idea to bite the palm tree and pop it, which led to water streaming down the isle on the bus.

so i finally arrive home, absolutely soaking wet 'cause it was pissing it down. my nan's still up and starts shouting at me to put my wet clothes to the wash so i don't get anything wet. i then decide it's a good idea to go and sit outside, stark bollock naked, and have a cig. which leads to me thinking it'd be a good idea to massage the cyclops. so i'm there, tugging away with some porn on my phone. then a fucking bellowing sound of ""what do you think you're doing!"" comes from behind me. i turn around, nan's there.

wake up next morning, nan says to me ""do you know what you were doing last night?"" to which a swift ""no"" was replied and carried on with my day.",got fucking hammered and got caught wanking in the garden by my nan.
555,"well actually last night. recently my headset stopped working so i have been using earbuds to listen to games and videos on my computer. i wanted to watch a movie on netflix and having no speakers other than the earbuds i decided to move my computer closer to my bed so i could lay in it an watch the movie. my desk is a glass desk and my computer case has rubber feet. well without thinking about it i picked up my computer and moved it a bit. what went wrong was when it wasn't enough and i scooted it a little. the rubber feet on the glass desk made it bounce a bit. the one slight inch or two killed my computer. it blue screened and restarted so i just turned it off and went to bed. i woke up this morning and turned it on. it brought up a screen called startup repair. i sat there for 30 minutes as it apparently tried to repair my fuck up. i can't really say i'm surprised it couldn't... :/

no big deal right? just buy a new hard drive and re-install windows right? well i would if i had any money. i am 19 and have been trying for months to get a damn job and with no luck. apparently having my own car and telling them i am available weekends, nights, holidays, as many hours as you need me, etc. isn't enough to get a job at a fast food place or a stocking position.

i can't help but laugh at my stupidity. guess i am using my parents extremely slow laptop to continue filling out job applications. :)",rubber feet plus motion on a glass desk is a no-no for a hard drive. :)

557,"background: i was working at one job when i found another, so i gave my two weeks. i had been friendly at work with managers in another department who were still technically supervisors to me. this meant no fraternization because to them i was ""staff"" even though we are close in age.

so anyway...
after i gave my two weeks one of the managers and i are in private and he says to me, "" good thing about you not working here anymore is now we can *talk*...""
i was caught off guard and laughed it off, but i was flattered. then i remembered he was married, so i thought nope. but i replied to his texts (after i moved onto my new job) against my better judgement. he said he just wanted to talk, and talk he does. he claims his wife doesn't want to hear about his day blah blah blah, just needs to vent. i let him drop by my place twice after work a couple times, it was just a lot of talking. i felt guilty though. he has a wife and a small daughter! 

so last night he drops by again and we chat for a while but honestly i'm not interested in the guy and it just made me feel terrible. i knew he wanted more than just our little chats, too. so i told him that i felt bad, he shouldn't be stopping to see me, and maybe he should consider counseling with his wife so he could talk to her instead of going outside the relationship. from what he's said it sounds like two people under stress who are fighting because of it, something that could maybe be repaired. he sort of shrugged my suggestion off and i told him he really needs to think about what he's doing, and what he wants. i really meant it, i really didn't want to break some one's marriage.

today he texted me to tell me that he told his wife this morning he's leaving her.

(hooray! i am not pregnant.) anyways i was running late for my morning classes. so i grabbed a pad from my cabinet in a hurry and didn't even bother to look if i put it on right. c'mon now, i've done it a bunch of times i think i am a pro here!well... bad idea. my dumbass should had looked. turns out that i put it on sticky side up. and well lets say i am a women who loves the pubes. likes to have them trimmed/cut and simple. ha well i sat through class wondering why my ""lady parts"" felt unusual and rather sticky. and just plain out weird, i wont get into detail. lets just say it was a horrendous moment.so i kindly walked out of the classroom to the ladies room, pull down the pants and then i noticed... my poor tootsie was literally stuck to that damn wonderful pad of mine.my pubes where stuck to it as well and it was a pain in the ""vagina""(pun) to get it off. it felt as if i where getting a slow type of brazilian wax. i got rather angsty and thought ""maybe if i pull it off real fast it might not hurt"". well ladies and gentlemen i was **wrong!** i closed my eyes and pulled it off as fast as i could. there where literally pubes on the damn pad! i don't think i ever wanted to cry as much as i did today. my lady parts still hurt, and i have a zip lock bag filled with ice on them. ): ladies! please learn off of my mistake and **always** look if you put it on correctly.

559,"yeah yeah i know another ball shaving story. i never thought i would find myself in this position but here we go anyway. so i haven't seen my gf in a while (few months) so i've kinda just letting my mane rage pretty hard. i finally had a date lined up tonight so i was like yeah might as well manscape a little bit. well i normally do it with just a hand razor in the shower (ballsy i know), but this time i was like huh i should just use this small set of scissors. little did i know this would be life changing and has now changed the way i will manscape for the rest of my life. here's the fuck up: i'm basically done and getting a little fast and loose with the scissors, which is when i cut my sack pretty good. it bled for a while (probably about 40 minutes). i finally put a band-aid on it and went out with the gf, hoping that i would be able to duck out into the bathroom at some point, remove the band aid, and proceed to have sexytimes. well it essentially worked, was able to throw away the band aid and stop the bleeding before she went down there, so mission accomplished.",cut my sack with some scissors and it bled a lot while i tried to have a successful date night with the gf that included getting laid.**
560,"i've been a virgin for so fucking long. too long. i don't want to give numbers but, much longer than any of my friends. so naturally, when the opportunity came to have intercourse, i over thought things to a grave and dark extent.

so i was talking to this girl i've been casually flirting with for the last few months, and things were going good. she started making fun of my car, and i couldn't think because i had a raging erection and was trying to fix it by giving myself a [canadian belt buckle](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=canadian%20beltbuckle) through my pants pockets (an impossible task to say the least), so i just responded with ""blow me."" off the top of my head. she smiled and said ""well your birthday is coming up this weekend..."" fuck yes. go time. 

i got home that night and shaved the dark jungle that had developed from my tangled pubes and practically jizzed from the excitement of trimming the bush for the first time. i couldn't even hardly sleep that night, i just kept masterbating, over and over, until i was pretty sure i was shooting air out of my dick because my balls were so sucked dry.
the next day, being the internet addict that most of us are, i researched for hours the proper blowjob etiquette, and somewhere along my research, i read that pineapple can make your semen taste sweet.i thought *well i'll be damned if i don't have the sweetest cum in the western hemisphere by this weekend.* 

i drove to the store, bought 5 gallons of pineapple juice and 6 raw pineapples. i had 4 days to prepare my testicles. over a gallon and around 1 and a half pineapples every day. then, i had this thought. this fucking horrible thought. *what if it's not sweet, i have to know, i have to taste it.* i couldn't get the thought out of my head. i had talked myself into it after an hour. 

the next morning, i jumped in the shower with my mind set on what i was about to do. it probably took me around forty minutes to finish, because i was so disgusted with myself on what was about to go down. i turned off the shower. i had to make this quick before i can stop myself. finish in my left hand, pumping harder than i should have with my right. cramp up in my right quad. *don't give up.* i shoved my left palm in my mouth and licked quickly but efficiently. **what the fuck have i just done** i vomitted all over my shower immediately. i ran out of the shower without even cleaning any of the mess up and sprinted towards the mouthwash in my medicine cabinet. i rinsed with mouthwash probably seven times. nothing can ever get that flavor out of my memory. let me tell you something- *it's not fucking sweet*",semen is uncomfortably warm on the tongue.
561,"i was going to use a throwaway for this but fuck it, i deserve to be shit on for this.

this actually happened about a week ago at a good friend's college graduation party. i was pretty drunk and decided to piss into an empty beer cup. my friend and i usually fuck with people so we thought it'd be funny. didn't really have a plan for what i was going to do with it, maybe trick someone into taking a sip of it, i don't know, i'm an asshole. anyways, like i said i was pretty drunk and helping my buddy cook some sausage on the grill. once the sausage was done i cut a small piece to sample, and naturally took a sip of my nice cold beer because the sausage was right off the grill. it wasn't a timid sip either, rather a nice, big, wash-down-that-tasty-sausage gulp. 

my beer was neither cold, nor beer. at least it was my own piss and not someone else's.

563,"i'm a 16 year old girl and i'm quite small. like any lazy day i was just downing a total of two whole packs (12 in each pack) of these sugar-free mints called breathsavers. in about an hour i was getting that terrible gurgly sound from the deep depths of my stomache. everyone has had this sound at least one time in their life and we all know that it is the universal have-to-shit calling. 
what happens next i will not go into great detail but it was the worst night of my life. from about 9pm to 3am i was sleeping on the bathroom floor and getting up about every ten minutes to let loose yet another rain of shit. 
soon the pain subsided and after a little research i figured out the culprit was sorbitol. this artificial sugar alcohol is used in any ""sugar-free"" foods and apparently eating it in excess may cause ""explosive diarrhea."" so now here i am the next morning downing all the water i can because of the severe dehydration. sorbitol not even once.","ate lots of mints, had the shits of my life and pain i never want to relive."
564,"i was sitting on my couch eating a pear and being the lazy fucker that i am, i decided that i would throw the pear into garbage from where i was sitting. i flung the pear core at the garbage but apparently i'm not basketball player so the core bounced off the ceiling and hit a couple other objects before landing unceremoniously on the ground. 

i looked up at where the pear had hit the ceiling and see a green streak. so i decided to get out the cleaner and get rid of the stain. turns out blue coloured cleaner and a white ceiling aren't best of friends so as i was scrubbing the pear streak off the ceiling it started leaving a blue tinge in the paint. i thought that since it was just a white ceiling, i could paint over the spot with some white paint that they had left over after finishing the house. 

what i didn't know was that the ceiling was done with a matte finish while the paint i was using was a semi-gloss finish. so instead of covering up the stain, i just made it more noticeable.","tried to be a basketball player, fucked up and made a small stain into a bad paint job**"
565,"all right, let me set the stage for you.

it's 5:25pm, and my baseball team has been playing since. 4:30.  not too long of a game, and its winding down in the 6th (we play 7).
i've been pitching all day, and neither teams have been doing very well.  it's 1-1 and they have a runner on second, 1 out.  my catcher likes to give the sign to throw a breaking ball (for those of you that don't know, a breaking ball is a pitch that, basically, isn't a fastball), and this time he gives me a sign for a slider.  a slider is a pitch that involves a very fast ""snap"" of the wrist, and you tend to feel a small burn in your elbow.  i oblige, lift up my right leg (i'm a lefty) swing my arm flawlessly up over my head, and flick my wrist to throw the pitch.  well, i've had some problems with my arm recently, and this was the breaking point.  i heard a loud ""pop"" and a shooting pain in my elbow.  i butchered the pitch totally, and it flew at our dugout.  i was shouting every curse word i've known, and apparently, that's grounds for suspension in the ihsa.  so, on top of the possibility of never throwing a ball again, i'm suspended for two games.

567,"**this post is gross and could be potentially triggering** this actually happened a couple weeks ago, but i just found this sub and thought my story was worthy. i've been bulimic for a while and in order to hide the teeth marks, i tried to use other instruments to trigger my gagging. other things, like spoons and toothbrushes hurt and in my pathetic desperation to vomit, i saw one of my tampons and thought why the fuck not?

so i started throwing up but using (unwrapped) tampons. yep. no way this could go wrong, right? it did work out for a while... one day i waited for my roommate to go to class so i could do it and went about my routine, swallowed a little bit but thought nothing of it. a bit farther into it i just gulped it whole all of a sudden. i stood there in shock for a second as i gasped and grabbed my throat, but i could breathe. i was so scared, i rushed for my toothbrush and started shoving it down there to try and throw the tampon back up and i ended up with a mess of vomit and blood all over my hands and toilet. it was awful because i could feel the plastic at the back of my throat, but i couldn't get a grip on it to pull it out. i tried to convince myself i could just let it go through my digestive system, but i knew that was fucking ridiculous. 

i asked my roommate to take me to urgent care without explanation in hopes to avoid an expensive er trip, which meant i waited a whole night with a tampon in my throat. i told my boyfriend the truth, and he still is the only one who knows the truth, and he was pissed that i wouldn't just go to the er, and also pissed because i lied to him about ending my bulimia but most of all he was worried. well, next day, urgent care couldn't do it and i had to spend hours at the er anyways. i waited so long to get drugged, awkwardly explain that there was a tampon in my throat because ""i was drunk and my friends dared me to swallow it"" and have a camera shoved down my throat. 
the only other two who even know something happened think i swallowed  something else because i ""was just absentmindedly chewing"" on it. now i have a huge hospital bill because i have no insurance. i also have pics of the tampon in my throat, which are kinda cool and kinda depressing.","swallowed a tampon trying to throw up, eating disorders drive you to do stupid ass things and never have one please**"

569,"a few hours ago i went with my fwb to a local 24-hour diner for an after-midnight dinner. we had a nice dinner, but all throughout the meal she was being very flirty and playful in an erotic sort of way (but subtle enough so as to not be indecent). let's just say ol' willy got a rise out of all the attention.

cut to the end of the meal. we paid for the meal and walked out the door. at this point i was almost ready to pounce on her. then, suddenly, it happened: my shorts just slid down my legs on their own volition, **right as new customers were approaching the front door.** private johnson was still at attention at this point, but thankfully it was dark enough that nobody noticed. i swore like a sailor with tourette's as some drunk kid laughed at me and i quickly yanked my shorts back up. we got in the car and drove off. needless to say i was no longer in a frisky mood after that.

572,"this was a month and a half ago. i wanted to post this shortly after, but i had to make sure there were no legal implications.

so my sink had been leaking, or rather, had a slight drip when off for a few months. i decided i'd like to fix it. read a bunch of articles on it, went to home depot, and got me a replacement knob and o-rings.

every article mentioned ""turning the water supply off."" try as i might, the valves underneath my sink just wouldn't turn. it seems they were rusted shut. what's the worst that could happen, right?

start disassembling the hot water knob. successfully removed. ""huh, this sure is easy.."" take a wrench to the next part. explosion. hot water in my face. where my hot water knob used to be, an insane geyser. it's shooting 6+ feet up to the ceiling. 

i panic. i immediately drop to the floor to try and get to the valve. i try my hardest. it's not budging. i try to push against the geyser to get the part back on...what a joke. there's no stopping it. at this point, i am freaking out badly.

the water keeps pouring in. at this point the water is going out of my bathroom. i frantically use my smartphone to find the apartment complex front office's phone number. i want so badly to call them and say ""jesus fuck you have to shut the water off to this building shit just got fucked up."" but there is no answer. i realize i have to call 911.

so i do that. i'm traumatized. the boiling geyser has created so much steam that my apartment is super foggy. so foggy, that the fire alarm is going off. the water has left the bathroom and is now seeping into the bedrooms. i hear a knock on the door. it's my downstairs neighbor. they are wondering why the fuck there is water dripping from most of their ceiling.

after what feels like an eternity, but was probably about 10 minutes, the fire department finally shows up. they go into the geyser room/the bathroom. they try to turn off the valve, but that shit is stuck. heroically, after about 4 or 5 minutes and crazy firefighter tools, they were finally able to get it shut off. 

i live on the 3rd floor. i caused lots of damage. all the carpet and hardwood in my apartment had to be ripped up and replaced. the people below me?

had to re-do the entire ceiling. more than half the drywall. all the carpet. the room below them? had to have the drywall replaced on one side.

575,"i guess you could say this all started yesterday, i took my girlfriend to the cinemas, paid for a movie and in the middle of it she just whispered to me that we were over because i had eaten all the popcorn.  
there was probably more to it than me just eating all the popcorn, but i wouldn't know.    
so lets bring that to earlier today. i went out for a run, and i came back and just went straight to the small couch of my flat and started doing **it**.    
so here i was, doing it with tears coming down my face, most of my clothes were off when a bird came flying in and started trying to make a nest of my hair. in a panic, my arm hit the wall and i could instantly feel that it was broken, or at least something was wrong.    
at this point, i thought i had hit rock bottom but almost instantly, i heard the doorbell ring. i tried to shout or say something like go away, but it was my step-sister who had a key to the house, and in a panic with my arm still in my pants and one arm broken/shattered, i instantly stood up and tripped over my own pants that was down at my ankles, falling down and breaking my nose and hitting my ballsack at the same time. the bird had ripped out a lot of my hair, and snot, tears, blood and more bodily fluids were everywhere.    
my step-sister drove me to the hospital and just left me there in the waiting room for the two minutes it took for me to get a room. to be fair, me and my step-sister had never been close, but then the doctor came in and the entire time that we were talking and he was trying to find out what happened, i was letting out the longest farts in existence, and he just kept on looking at me. i had never felt so distant from anyone, as i realized no one was really there for me, today i royally fucked up.","i was masturbating, a bird attacked my head, i broke my arm and then my step-sister walked in with my hands down my pants."
576,"soooooooooooo...

yeah.

i like to play guitar.

actually i love to play guitar.

but my guitar decided to get revenge on me for constantly plucking at it's strings.

first off, i was in guitar class, and i was trying to log into my school laptop to write down some notes.

i stupidly placed my guitar on my expensive headphones. 

this wasn't stupid because it could break them, it was stupid because once i finished writing down the a, a#, e, and e# bar chords, class was ending. i quickly packed up everything. at least... everything i could see that i needed.

the last thing i packed was my guitar, and so once i grabbed it, i didn't look back to see my headphones.

i left them in my guitar class.

the second fuck up is more of an embarrassment, and how i choose my fate.

i was in cooking class, and got sent out to do an assignment.

i head down to the stairwell known as the ""sex hall"" due to it never being used, therefore the best place to skip class, work in peace, or... get intimate. 

as i'm sitting down, i decide i'll practice playing a song my sister's boyfriend wrote. (i play it much differently. same chords with one added, and a different pattern.) as i place the guitar in my lap, i hear that one sound you never want to hear when sitting down, accompanied by that feeling of released tension around the groin.

***rrrrriiiiiiiiiiiip***

aww fuck... i just ripped my newly sewn jeans... in the crotch... while sitting in the sex hall with a friend of mine, who is also a guy. 

this is not good.

i will never trust my dad's sewing skills again.

for once, i'm glad i have ocd when it comes to my outfits. 

i always wear a regular shirt, then over that an unbuttoned beige shirt, then my brown roundtree and yorke: charlotte jacket.

i take off the jacket and button up shirt, then wrap it around my waist overtop of the regular shirt. in hindsight, it would have looked better done up under the shirt, but whatever.

i put on the jacket, then unhook my chain from my belt loop, and attach it to my backpack strap, and put the wallet it's attached to in the inside pocket of the charlotte. 

i look pretty damn cool... except for the fact that i appear to be wearing a fucking dress.

it was at this time that i realized i left my headphones in my guitar class. fuck.

i now had to walk literally all the way across the top floor of the school.

the door was locked. 

now i had to go downstairs and to the center of the school (which is the most crowded) to get to my locker. 

instead of merging with the crowd, assassin style, everyone makes way for me to walk through. jaws hit the floor and slam back up to the owner's face as they laugh their asses off at the guy in a leather jacket, a chain, and a fucking dress.

i grab my shit and run.

i phoned the school to leave a message about the headphones, asking if they could be grabbed and stored until tomorrow, when i go to my next class.

i feel like a fucking retard, and now i'm sitting in my ripped jeans because my others are in the wash. and the way the rip is angled, whenever i fart, it's blasted directly into my face.

they smell like rotten deviled eggs and pickles!

-------------------------------------------------------

 

-------------------------------------------------------

edit: should probably mention that when my pants ripped, we all laughed, and my one friend walked out of the stairwell laughing his ass off (most likely to tell everyone what happened) and the other one stayed around while i put on the ""dress"" so we could make terrible jokes and laugh.

it all went pretty well... until i had to leave the stairwell to get my shit.","i left my expensive headphones in class, ripped my jeans in the sex hall, and have to smell my own farts. this is all due to my guitar."
577,"sounds like a good thing right? i've been talking to this girl for a few months, we talk everyday for hours and i had been to visit her a couple of times before.*important*:she already knows i have a crush on her! anyway... more recently i've been feeling like there really is a connection there so i was super excited to go and see her again. after a really nice day of hanging out and having fun we basically end up falling asleep together on her bed cuddling. a little while passes until she suddenly sits bolt upright and says "" i think it's time to go to bed. "" my heart starts pounding, thinking shit - should i have not cuddled her? i thought this had been going well! i ask her if i should leave and sleep in the spare room like i had done the time before. she says "" you can stay in here if you want "" my heart is in my mouth at this point. i get into bed and basically fall asleep with her in my arms, this is just fucking perfect! 
  now the day after we hang out some more and i travel back home feeling like a fucking boss but whilst we chat that evening it transpires that she felt really awkward about the whole thing and didn't like me cuddling her, didn't like how i looked at her sometimes and claims to not know how i feel. she hardly talks to me now and i feel like the biggest idiot there ever was :c","girl invites me into her bed, tells me the day after that she didn't want me there."
578,"so we were in chicago for a model un conference (college). on the first night, my friend and i ate a bunch of edibles, and then invited the delegation into our room for drinks (mind you, the hotel has a strict no alcohol policy).  we then proceed to receive noise complaint after noise complaint, until the hotel night manager decides she's had enough and brings a security guard up to our room.  she then starts pounding on the door, at which my my friend and i answer the door.  we then proceed to ask her what the matter is, and she says that we're about to be evicted from the hotel.  when i go to answer, she cuts in and asks if i'm intoxicated. i say no, just pretty drunk. but then i tell her that i came from a bar, and that it's not against policy to be drunk (all the while, i'm holding a slurpee that is about 30% vodka).  my friend then diverts the conversation, but the manager insists that we are being far to loud and that we need to stop immediately.  i then inform the manager that ""i have it under control, i'm in a frat!"" she then has no words, and says that we have to go to sleep immediately, and that one more noise complaint and we will be kicked out immediately.  also, she gives us a fine for $250, the cost of reimbursing this russian lady down the hall who had been filing all of the noise complaints.","hotel manager tells me that i'm being too loud, i tell her it's ok, i'm in a frat"
579,"this was actually over the weekend, but i think it was such a bad fuck up that i made a throwaway to write this, so here goes:

i was at the bar with my friend and his gf. they were both dancing and i was just hanging out by myself basically. then this girl approaches me and we start dancing. one thing leads to another and we start making out. then she put her hand down my pants for an under the pants hj. needless to say i was surprised at how fast things were moving. 

then a few moments passed and were on a couch nearby, making out again. this time she proceeds to unzip my pants and started performing fellatio on me. now i had to stop her, since we were in a public place and i could seriously get in trouble for this. i tried to convince her to spend the night at a hotel or something like that. for some reason, she wouldn't agree to it. we were (obviously) a little drunk. so instead i just gave her my number and she agreed we would talk later. 

the next day goes by and nothing happens. i figure she either didn't remember what happened or was so embarrassed about it that she wouldn't say anything to me again. then on monday at work i got a text from her. so we started texting each other a little bit. when i got home, i decided to google her number to see if i could find her on facebook or some sort of blog. then i found her personal business page. it turns out she was an escort. in her 'about me' section it said: measurements are 36c-29-36 **with a fully functional 7 in. surprise.**so ever since this discovery, i haven't decided whether or not to laugh uncontrollably or hang myself. but i thought i would share it with you guys. 

just an fyi i want to let it be known this post is not a slam against transgender/sexuals/etc. if you are engaged in any of that stuff that is your business and i am not making any sort of judgement in this post. i am a straight male so it was just a bit of a shock for me.","got a bj from a girl at a bar, it turns out it was a shemale"
580,"so i play tennis for my high school team, and my first practice was yesterday. it was the first strenuous activity i've had in a while, so my thighs were aching like a bitch. i waited it out, and this morning they were still hurting, so i decided to use some icy-hot so i could get through practice after i took my morning shower. just then, i checked the clock and saw that i was running out of time. i hurried to put on clothes and ran to the car.

i arrived at practice, and for the first ten minutes i was fine. but then i felt a burning on my glutes, and was wondering what was going on. so the next drink break, i went to the bathroom to check it out. turns out, my underwear and shorts scraped up all of the icy-hot from my thighs and collected it on my ass. so i had to go through the rest of the two-and-a-half hour practice with burning asscheeks.",having burning asscheeks sucks.
581,"so i'm on vacation in europe, in my hometown. i was out late last night so i woke up around noon. to my surprise there was already people at my house. i brushed my teeth and went down stairs where everyone was at. it was a bunch of old people except for this one girl. she looked to be anywhere from 21 to 25. stunning. beautiful. so i say hi to everyone, introduce myself and sit down. i can't stop looking at this girl. next thing you know she gets up to go to the bathroom and i can't stop staring at her ass. she was wearing tight jeans. this girl had the entire package. beautiful face, slim waist, thick ass, and legs to kill for. 

so i think, ""fuck it. i'm gonna go for it.""
 
as soon as she gets back i start making small talk with her and start flirting a little bit. she didn't seem to be having it, i just thought i had to step my game up. 

10 minutes go by full of small talk, teasing, and sexual innuendos before my dad goes ""yeah, ninetytwo92, you should go out and grab a drink with her. since we were here longer you can show her around town. but don't let anything happen to her, since you're the older cousin you have to protect her. hahaha"" 

that's when it hit me that i've just been fantasizing about fucking my cousin for the past 10 minutes, and that this poor girl as been sitting here for these past 10 minutes listening to me hit on her. oh and on top of all of this, turns out she's only 17. i'm 22.",saw a girl that i didn't know was my cousin. girl is hot. i start drooling over said girl and start hitting on her. turns out girl is my cousin. turns out girl is a lot younger than i thought she was.
582,"so my wife and i are adopting two kittens today and have been preparing the kitten room, cleaning thoroughly and setting everything up. vacuuming was my job, and i was doing a damn good job (imo). i should inform you that we have one of those dyson cyclone vacuums that has the cylinder that you detach and then press the button to empty from the bottom. so i detach the cylinder and hold it over the trash bag to empty. i press the button-dust, dirt and hair all over the floor while only a small amount made it into the bag. i curse silently, turn the vacuum back on and go to work. i had gotten most of it back into the vacuum when the garbage bag was caught by the vacuum and tipped over, spilling the rest of the vacuum's prior contents onto the floor. i cursed again (not silently this time) and cleaned the rest of it up. such a simple task and yet, tifu.","tried to empty vacuum into garbage bag, emptied onto floor and garbage bag instead, cleaned up, vacuum tipped the garbage over and emptied the rest of it, had to do it again. i need a shower and a drink."
583,"i recently got new car with manual transmission. given that last time i drove stick was about 20 years ago i am still trying to get used to it, but i love it!

earlier today i was getting ready to drop my little one at day care and as usual go start the car. typically i first put her in car seat, but this time for whatever reason started the car first. my driveway is at the angle so when i park the car nose facing the road i put gear in reverse, e-break on. so my daughter is standing just to the left of driver's side rear door. i push the clutch in, start the car, but forget to put gear in neutral. car jerks back pretty fast but not by much. this scared the hell out of my daughter pretty bad i guess and all i see in the mirror her turning around and running towards garage door, which was closed, plummeting her little pretty face right in it. i don't know why, but i chucked a bit (i know it's bad) and jumped out to see if she ok. she was fine, not a scratch. i guess she didn't know what has happened so there were no tears. all she said was, ""daddy wanted to hurt me!"" i am a monster.",i am a monster
584,"i wake up from a nap after i get home from school, and i have to pee. so i step outside and start peeing into the bushes next to some firewood (which is really just a tree that fell down in the yard). i must have startled this little lizard, so he scurries out which in turn startles me. i was curious, so i pick up the log a little bit to see him, and as i'm holding it my dog rushes me knocking me off balance. you already know what happens next. the log falls on his little arm, shoulder, and part of his head. he's squirming around in circles, and i just feel absolutely terrible. i couldn't just let him slowly die, so i look around for something to put him out of his misery with. i pick up the shovel to my immediate right and put it through the poor guy's brain stem. so now i have this decapitated lizard in my backyard, with a dog who thinks it's his new toy. i managed to dig a small hole and bury the poor thing without my dog getting to it.

i just had a pet bearded dragon pass about a month ago after 10 years of owning her, so this really bothered me today.","crushed a lizard with a log, then proceeded to decapitate it during my afternoon wee"
585,"who knew that a block of chocolate in purple wrapping could have went awry in a manner like this?

i don't eat chocolate much as it's not really my thing but i do every so often and it happens that this fine tuesday morning, i fancy a turkish delight. i pull it out the fridge, place it on the table. scan it for the amount of carbs it has. 40g of carbs or there about. spin the needle into my insulin pen, dial it all up, inject 4 units (1 unit for each 10 carbs) and then eat it. perfect. wonderful. lovely.

so, i get a call and it's my friend asking if i am showing up to first period. i forget that it's a tuesday, still in the monday mindset and i am extremely late. i have about 30 minutes to do just about everything.

the next twenty minutes are dedicated to my daily routine, shove on some clothes, gather my books and done. out the door, 10 minutes until lesson.

i make it into english, 30 minutes late thanks to public transport being itself and the rest doesn't really come into play until about 2 hours later; our morning break.

grab the usual ham sandwich, slide open the case of my insulin pen and just as i swing my arm across to pull my arm out of my jumper. it happened. i felt a sharp, burning pain in my wrist, though more my hand and it took a while for me to realize it was quite serious pain. painful pain. so, i glance down and blood is there, not a lot but enough for it to start being something i need to sort the fuck out. i had left the old needle on the pen.blood spraying, blood dripping. friend's laughing until they realize this is quite a serious situation. one helps me out of my jumper, we wrap it around the bleeding area, apply a little pressure as if it were a stab wound and then just wait while my other friend notifies the medical center in our university. we take it off after a while, first aid give me some sort of discolored, peachy, plaster and i shove it on and go about my day.

i just got home and took it off. an inch long cut just above my wrist veins but just below the base of my hand, looking much deeper than i first thought.

it's not hurting so much now but i dread the moment i soak it in water.","insulin isn't heroin, don't try and shoot it in a vein."
586,"so last saturday it was my friend birthday and he invited the boys to go out for diner at a new restaurant in town.  the service was horrible, but the wine and beer was flowing and the waitress, oh my god the waitress, they were hot.  small skirts, some with huge breast, some small, brunette, blonde, they're all pretty and in top shape.  as an almost married man in his early 30's i can't contain myself not to be aroused by those young sexy appealing girls.  my single friends are all over them and the only think i can think of all night, is to go back at my place and fuck the hell out of my girlfriend.

after a few more drinks we go to the bar to conclude the night and of course i'm still thinking about sex the whole time.  so the night goes on and we close the bar and one of my sober friend drives me home. i'm still horny as a 13 yo who just saw his first porno so i go up to my girlfriend to wake her by telling her how much i want to fuck her and she is, luckily for me, very responsive and wants to have rough sex.

we have one of those crazy sex session, it's amazing, she's screaming out of joy, it's awesome!  we both finished off, i get off her and she goes to clean herself up.  by the time she come back, i was already asleep and snoring.

we wake up the next day, and she tell me how awesome the sex was last night, but at the same time she's looking at me with this funny smile and almost laughing, and i ask her ""what's funny?"".  ""you don't remember, do you?"".  to be honest with you guys, it's not the first time after sex like that, that i fall asleep and don't remember how i actually fell asleep, so i tell her ""no?!?"".  ""well, last night after sex, i went to clean my self up and when i came back you were laying on the bed with your erected shaft and the dog was licking the hell out of it.""... ""what?!?""  i tell her that she must be fucking kidding me, but she reassure(obviously not the best choice of word here) me that it's unfortunately true.  i'm not sure what to think of it, but at least i don't remember it.

 

**edit**: i just want to emphasis that i was deeply asleep and the dog raped me.","dog gave me a blowjob, but at least i don't remember it."
587,"one day, when me and my father were picking up my sister from a friends party i noticed they had a zip line. it looked awesome, but ended right over the driveway - not the hottest idea, i decided to give it a shot anyways. i checked it was all clear and i had my dad pull me about half way up the hill. i decided that was more than enough for the first time in the dark. i released and started gaining momentum, sitting on the shitiest little plastic seat in the world. i rotated to my side and admired the cool breeze of the night. i turned to face back toward the end zone just in time to see the flash of the porch light on the hood of a bmw m5 sitting right were i was going. having had about 0 seconds to do anything, i hit the car's driver side door with my full momentum and my head whip lashed over the frame of the door.

i fell off the seat and the world went momentarily black as i laid on the ground. within seconds there was a pack of little girls screaming bloody murder, and telling everyone i was dead. i got to my feet and regained my vision. by now, the entire party was outside, staring at me and asking if i was ok. i stood and inspected the damage. as odd as it may sound, a bmw was probably the best thing i could have hit out of all the cars in the driveway. my body and the door absorbed most of the impact and my head only snapped over the top of the car, rather than hitting the window. 

all in all, it turned out just fine. i left a perfect imprint of my hip, knee and shoulder in the car door. the door had to be totally replaced because i crushed the impact bar, the window mechanism and the lock. the owner was very nice about it and his insurance ended up covering it. i walked away fine, and had an awesome story. 

long story short is: check where your zip line goes.",zip lined into a car door.
588,"so i was at a friend's house and we were just sitting around playing games and i feel a shit coming on. i excused myself to the bathroom and started my shit. i thought it would be a normal one but it decides to be the wettest shit ever. i shit so much it piled up and no water was visible in the bowl. best way to explain it is it looked like a cow's shit. anyways, when i tried to flush noting happened, it just stayed. i felt so embarrassed about it that i didn't tell them about it.

fast forward to a couple hours later and i'm on skype with the friend. he's telling me that it wouldn't go down and my shit was fermenting in the toilet for a couple hours. i'm also not allowed over again and they had to call a plumber which i'm probably going to have to pay for. to make matters worse, it was my first (and last) time over there. the toilet may also be broken.",took a shit the hulk would be shocked by in my friends toilet the first time i went over. not allowed over again and paying for plumber.
589,"to paint the picture here: my roommate's assigned spot is to the right of mine, and to park i approach from the left, so i have to watch my right-front corner so it doesn't hit her rear-left corner.

when i was coming home from work i was pulling into my parking spot like i've done many, many times before, except this time i misjudged the distance between my car's front bumper and my roommate's car's rear bumper and ended up bumping into it. now there are scratches on both our cars (mine got it worse), and i'm trying to figure out the next step. i haven't called my insurance yet but both our parents have been called (mine took the news *much* better) for advice and whatnot and we're trying to figure what to do next (e.g. paint vs bumper replacement), and whether involving insurance is in our best interest (but i'm thinking that's what will end up happening).

[behold, pictures of my fuckup!](http://imgur.com/a/qwlj6) my car is the blue one. oh, and the red paint on it is from an earlier thing,  

so there you go, your daily dose of schadenfreude. if anyone has any advice feel free, otherwise just remember to pay better attention to what you're doing on the road. drive safe, kids!

tl;dr played bumper cars with my roommate's car in our garage, trying to figure out next steps.","realized it too late to simply wash off and i don't really care about it enough to spend the money to fix just that. of course, this thing today is a whole other matter entirely."
590,"last night i decided to go out drinking with some friends, one of which i used to have strong feelings for.   drank almost an entire bottle of alcohol before heading to the bars.  made sure everyone had their share, including her.  i know peoples limits well, so i got her to a fun tipsy drunk level and stopped and started giving her water.  never bought her a drink at the bar, just water...i however, kept drinking.  left, got burgers, and got back to her friends house.  proceeded to spill my guts about how i was jealous of her boyfriend and how i still had feelings for her, making things awkward for everyone around.  sometimes i just can't help myself even when i know i should stop talking.  and then i puked, in the toilet, thankfully.  probably because they all force fed me gatorade to make me ""feel better.""","drank with girl i like, spilled my guts out in front of friends, then spilled my guts out."
591,"so i live next to my parents, in the country so my family is close by. my gf was over so we decided to wrestle/cuddle. she was on my lap pinning me down and it looked like we were having sexy time. i'm 16 and that's when my grandma came in. i ate taco bell and a prune smoothie, it wasn't sitting very well and when she came in, i panicked and shit my self. it wasn't normal shit it was taco-bell-smoothie shit. it stained the white sheets and now my gf isn't talking to me.

592,"so on a friday night my mate and i were on our way to a party, i had a bag with me holding all our drinks and my friends computer (fucked if i knew why he brought a computer to a party). anyway we got to the platform our trains leaving from and i see the train sitting there, so i shit myself because i thought it was leaving and proceed to commando dive onto the train and break all the beers in my bag, ruining my clothes and my friends computer. my friend then casually walks in after me and asks me what the fuck i am doing. turns out the train didnt leave for 10 minutes. however while i was trying to dry everything off the train really did leave.
my friend was not pleased",leave commando dives to the professionals
593,"i dropped a glass measuring cup on on the ground and it shattered. i cleaned it all up and i noticed one of the pieces had a large sharp edge to it. naturally, i started cutting things with it, seeing how sharp it was, and it worked very well. anyway, i was cutting things and i picked up a piece of cardboard that i thought it would have trouble cutting through (and it did), and i cut a little too forcefully. my hand jerked past the cardboard, and the glass cut a huge part of my finger. it cut through the wrinkly part covering my upper knuckle on my index finger like butter. pretty fucking scary. i put pressure on the part that was cut, hoping to prevent the bleeding, and ran to get a band-aid. the band-aid was filled up with blood too quickly so i had to cut the circulation to my finger using my earphone cord. i've had the band-aid on for a few hours, it stopped bleeding a while ago. i hope there isn't too much scarring...",i fucked around with broken glass and cut a huge chunk out of my finger

595,"welp, today is just not my day.

so its a snowy icy day here in mn (shocker right?), and on my way home, i take an entrance ramp to get onto i-94. im going about 30 on the outer lane being cautious of the ice when suddenly two state trooper squad cars appear on the side dealing with another collision. 

so me being the law abiding citizen decides to switch to the inner lane so i dont get ticketed for not doing it. 2 seconds later i collide with the side barrier and now my bumpers fucked and my dad is pissed at me cause he thinks im lying about how shit went down.",", got myself hit on the highway barrier while following state traffic law."
596,"woke up for work this morning and i was pretty close to a zombie. i managed to get myself to the bathroom without too much trouble and started my morning routine.  sat down, leaned into the shower and started it up because it takes at least 5-10 minutes to get hot water this early in the morning. once i can feel the warmth of the shower water filling the bathroom i finish my business, stand up and step into the shower.  

one foot in (ahh that feels good, scalding hot but i can fix that once i am in), step in with second foot… crunch.   something crispy was under the arch of my foot.  it wasn’t me and whatever it was it should not be under my foot.  keeping calm so that i didn’t flail, fall, scald myself on the really hot water or wake up everyone, i lifted my foot and examine whatever was under my foot.  i found a spider that obviously had seen better days.  he was flattened like a pancake, all 8 of his legs dangling in the flowing water.  he looked like a small flat octopus.  spiders are not my favorite, so i backed into the corner of the shower and scooped water at him to slowly flush him towards the drain. 

so with the crime scene washed away, i stood in the shower for quite some time washing the sensation of crunchy under my foot out of my memory. it didn’t work…  it is now many hours later and the thought of that crunchy feeling is still giving me shivers.

(edit)",– stepped into the shower and crunch.  bad feelings had by all.
597,"yesterday, i went to my friends house. its like my second home, my second family, so i went straight to doing work and to my daily routine. as i went downstairs to grab a midnight snack, their family precious beagle found me and followed me up.

it was an omen that i was having a fiber bar, but fuck me right?

i laid down on the couch and soon after eating my snack, i was fast asleep. but i awoke to the craziest, most demonic shit imaginable. the beagle climbed on the bed and was dragging his ass across the portion of the sheets i wasn't on, howling. then he promptly walked over to my surprised face and plopped his butt on my neck. surely, i thought, this was all a ruse to get attention.

but then it was war.

sure enough the gasses erupted, one fart after another, expunged into my face. i cried out in agony as my nose flared (maybe a bit too dramatic) and my eyes teared up from the exposure to all that disgusting, poop smelling, fartyness. then the beagle thought it would be a marvelous idea to sit on my face while farting. but i attempted to smack him off the bed, and he plopped down with a bark, shitting on the carpet. he then dragged his ass 'all over town' and made sure i was watching his mighty exit into the hallway. i think this goes to show how whenever these lovely things happen to me, and i try to defend myself, i have to clean up poo all over a white carped from a proud dog.","beagles have a natural way of stinking up your face, and when pushed away, they shit. they fucking shit on a white ass motherfucking carpet."
598,"the f-up really happened friday night, i just found out about the repercussions today. 

i’ve been at my job for about 7 months, and work second shift. right after i was hired, another woman was hired to work the second shift with me. almost as soon as she finished her month of training, we find out that she is a cancer patient who got hired during a period of good health, but then took a turn for the worse and had to go on chemo again. the horrible part is that she refuses to take time off, and instead drags her irradiated, neuropathic, exhausted self to work every night…and is worse than useless at the job once she’s here. her badass stubbornness is awesome, but i’ve gotten really stressed-out  and frustrated over the last few months because i have to do the work of two people and i haven’t been here that long myself. 

that’s the situation that leads to her not showing up for work on friday evening, and not calling anyone to let them know that she can’t make it in. my coworkers and supervisor stay late to help me with some work, but i end up doing the bulk of it alone, which is fine because that’s what i do anyway. 

but then, about  an hour before i clocked out for the weekend, she called the office line. she said that she can’t see very well in the dark, and got lost while driving to work around 6pm (it’s almost 10 now) but will be in soon. i try to tell her how crazy it is that she got lost for hours and didn’t call anybody,  try my best to tell her not to come in, to call someone to pick her up. but she refused , saying she’d be there in a minute, and finally hung up on me. i called her back and tried to give her our supervisor’s home phone number, but she made up more excuses, insisted that she’d be at work in a minute and hung up on me again. i freak out, but don’t really know what to do since she didn’t tell me where she was at the time she called. she finally comes in right as i’m leaving, so i just quickly duck away and decide to keep quiet about the weird call. 

then come tuesday, my boss informs me that the woman’s family called her saturday evening hysterical because no one had seen her since friday night. the police were called, and they found her in her car in the employee parking garage, where she refused any ems treatment. i feel awful because i could have at least let someone know about the call so they might have an idea about her state of mind and thought to look for her sooner. i fucked up so much, i should have called a supervisor or security or something, she could really have been hurt.","disoriented cancerous coworker calls me, i tell no one and then she goes missing for a day"
599,"so me and the new girlfriend have recently started exploring a bunch of new ""firsts"" for us in the bedroom.  she has always been very anti-blowjob in her life, but she wanted to try it out with me and found that she actually loves it and now can't seem to get enough of it.  so after a few days of that, we then decide to give the 69 position a try because i love going down on her too.  perfect, right?

what i didn't think about was the fact that she gets very into it when i go down on her and cums hard and often.  which is usually amazing for both of us, but in this particular situation of her sitting on my face with my dick in her mouth turned out to be not quite so good.  

every time i would make contact with her clit, she would moan and start sucking a little harder.  i really kinda liked it, so i started putting the focus there and she started sucking harder and harder.  it felt pretty amazing but very intense, especially with her tongue going to work at the same time.  then i decided to try another first and sucked her clit into my mouth.  i knew she liked biting, so while i was sucking i was licking and gently nibbling as well and it drove her bananas.

she came so hard and the whole time she was griding into my face and gushing, basically suffocating and drowning me at the same time.  the problem is that she also began sucking on my dick like she was trying to do a vacuum cleaner impression and i was totally unable to move or say anything while i was being smothered.  when she finally came down she stopped and i rolled her off of me, but i was so sore.  we laid in the dark for a while, but when i got up to pee i looked down and noticed that the entire head of my penis was bright red.  about an hour later it turned into a discolored blotchy mess.  that's right, a hickey.

it's now sore beyond belief and every time it rubs up against my jeans it is incredibly painful.  i am now teasing her about it as often as possible, and she can't stop apologizing but also can't stop asking me how long it will be til we can have sex or she can give me another blowjob.  i hope it won't be too long, but ugh is it uncomfortable at this point.",my girlfriend sucked me so hard that she gave me a dickey**
600,"so about 24 hrs back i was smoking some weed and playing some fifa with a couple of friends. it was all going pretty good before friend no. 1 decided he wanted to go to sleep and i had the random urge to ingest some cough syrup. friend 2 actively encouraged me and i did two large shots. after doing some random shit, i kind of passed out and woke up still high. slept some more and started having weird sensations in different muscles. i feel better now but really drowsy and sleepy. any ideas on how to get this out of the system?",i am an idiot who had a large dose of cough syrup and now i am sleepy all the time.

602,"alright, i'm a student manager of campus summer services at my university for the summer with three other students, two girls and one guy.

 i told my roommate that it wasn't possible to room with him since he's not a student manager (some weird reason)

yesterday was my day off, so i was playing some heroes of newerth in the library. i get a text from my supervisor that someone has moved into her apartment that's not supposed to.

 i also got a text from my old roommate saying that he just got into an apartment that had girly packaging and stuff, and mentioned the room number which was my supervisors room. since i was in the middle of a game, i kept playing, and didn't respond to either of them until an hour later. 

turns out, our overall manager kinda freaked out because he wasn't supposed to get into that apartment, and since he knew me and i hadn't answered right away to my supervisor or to him telling him he had to leave, they said that i was very close to losing my position for the summer.",don't ignore texts over video games -.-
603,"yesterday i had lunch with my mom and i told her about my back pain and how it had been a few days and i think i might be dying... bla bla bla. she pulls out her prescription bottle of ""muscle relaxers"" and says ""go ahead and take one of these, it'll help make the muscles loosen up."" i ask her what the interactions may be, and her response is, ""it may make you a little tired."" i take the pill and she drops me off back at work, i work for a university doing it work. i was sitting at my desk carrying on with my bid'ness as usual when my monitors start to pulsate and my body starts to pulsate. after about five minutes i realize it's getting exponentially worse and my reaction time is slowing (including my speaking) and my eyes are beginning to close. i get a little nervous about this and start to plan my options. i cannot drive at this point because i'll probably fall asleep and die on my scooter, i can't sleep at my desk because i work at a cubicle. i slowly get up and realize i'm gonna have to find somewhere to sleep because i am about to pass the fuck out. i looked everywhere on my level of the building, and i vaguely remember walking into my friend's office while he was in the middle of a meeting, letting myself in and just sitting on a chair in the middle of his conversation and in the slowest voice imaginable asking him to ""heellllp meeeeee."" 

i don't remember how that conversation ended because i was so delirious and literally was in the process of passing out. my eyes would stay open for 2 seconds at a time and i could barely walk. i stumble out of his office and get on the elevator and take it to the 6th floor for some reasons that do not exist. i've never even been to the 6th floor. i wonder the halls grabbing onto walls to help keep my balance and finally i find a small break room with a couch in it. mind you, this couch is the size of a very small child so i don't really fit on it. at this point i couldn't give a fuck less this baby is commmin. this baby being my unconsciousness. 

i positioned myself on the couch so that my legs were sticking up in the air and my feet were basically kicking the refrigerator of this break room. i'm wearing a dress by the way, so this shit did not look glamorous. i tried to cover my legs and stuff as much as possible, but it's not really an easy thing or a priority to cover your underwear when the only care in your life is sleep, so with half my ass hanging out, i passed the fuck out. i kept trying to wake up because, well beyond the obvious reasons people were also coming in and out of this very popular break room because it was god damn lunch time. i remember at times i would hear someone come in and sit straight up and then pass out again. at one point i opened my eyes while lying down and made awkward eye contact with some guy in a business suit and we did the typical fake smile and nod of acknowledgment as if this wasn't the most awkward thing to happen to either of us all day, then i went back to sleep. i slept there for 3 fucking hours. when i finally had the strength to get off of this tiny hellish couch, there were 3 people eating quietly at the breakroom table trying not to acknowledge me.

turns out my mom gave me her emergency anxiety medication and not muscle relaxers.",mom drugged me and i fell asleep in a crowded break room.**
604,the final was actually monday but i had it in my calendar as being on tuesday. so this morning i showed up to my class ready for my final after getting up at 6am this morning only to find an empty classroom. double checked the final schedule online and yep my final was yesterday. on the plus side i was able to get in touch with my professor and schedule a make up. guess not all hope is lost,tried to take my final a day late and showed up to an empty classroom at 7:15 in the morning.

606,"so, 

i moved from one state to another to pursue a job. this is not only a very great stepping stone into what could potentially be my dream job, but the job is very, very easy. it pays well and it's a great resume builder.

however i am on a probationary period and the only thing i was ever told to be mindful of was attendance because most people that don't keep their job have attendance issues. 

so instead of leaving my place at a reasonable hour before the start of my shift, i tend to leave at 25 minutes before the start of my shift and then run to the time clock. this normally works out for me but a few months ago i overslept and got dinged for coming into work a few hours late. i was shitting bricks that because of this i wouldn't pass probation and be fired. however, nothing came of it, so i guess i got lax again and today i ended up being 9 minutes late. so now i got 2 late attendance issues and i even got talked to by a supervisor. he said not to come in late again because he really likes me and wants to see me succeed.

now this doesn't sound so bad, but because i'm on probation i can be terminated at any time. and i'm worried this might be it. maybe i'm going to lose the biggest opportunity in my life because some asshole caused a crash on the only highway that leads to my workplace and so they blocked 2 of the 3 lanes of the highway and because i'm too stupid to anticipate that something like this might eventually happen.",i might be fired for being late from this really great job.
607,"this fuck up didn't happen today, about a week or so ago. but i need to spill. (no pun intended)

well, i'm a *really* scrawny guy. i'm like 5 foot something and 120 lbs. i had been meaning to go to my local gym's weight room for months now, never really got around to it. i am extremely weak. i have trouble lifting 50 pound amplifiers by myself, without a roadie's aid. 

my aunt had just passed, and we're having a graveside service and it's rather small. the rabbi asks for men to be the pallbearers. since it's such a small service, i am obligated to do so. myself, and my 3 cousins go up to do it. 

we lift the casket, and, boy, this thing is heavy. even with the 4 of us on each corner, (i'm on the rear left), this thing is unbearable for a man of my weak stature. 

we go to put her in the hole in the ground, and, well....

...reddit, i dropped the damn thing and....

....there was a spill. 

my kin were in shambles. the look on my poor ol' babushka's face was sheer horror. 

i can't even mentally grasp this fuck up.

608,"really this was like 3 months ago, but here goes. for christmas i got a three month membership to the local uxl, i wanted a personal trainer as i know nothing about working out. i work with a woman whose daughter is a trainer there and i wanted to train with her. i had a sit down with the head trainer and the overview he gave me was two months in advance, then after that going month to month until i wanted to cancel.

fast forward to april, while checking my banking i notice there's a $120 charge for for the personal training, after i said something to my trainer about noting wanting to renew. i talk to the guy, who's a real dick head, and he just puts on a shit eating grin and said yeah that was for a year, i can freeze your account and we can try and work something out. he then told me he would talk to the guy above him about getting me out of it.

i was checking my banking sunday and  noticed another $120 charge after he said he was supposedly going to freeze my account. every time i ask that guy how this negotiation is going, he keeps putting on his shit eating grin and telling me he will talk to him tomorrow. this is breaking me financially, i only work part time for the being, and i have almost over-drawn my account twice because of this. yesterday i took a good look at the contract, just to see how badly i was fucked, and not only is a year, i initialed for the automatic renewal, i only had *three fucking days* to cancel this. i'm fucked

 

edit: i talked to him today, and watched him put my account on freeze for 60 days. i am going to be up is ass every time i'm at the gym about this. if i am charged again next month i will take action with the bank. i have x-posted this to /r/legaladvice  and thank you for your advice.","shady, slick personal trainer sees me coming from a mile away, gets me to sign a contract i didn't read carefully enough, and now i'm locked into paying $120 a month 'til next february."

i realize now i should tell the employees. but then it dawns on me there are no other customers, and the employees cannot see me. so i decide to just make my escape and quickly walk off leaving the sugar and cream table covered in my iced coffee. yes i realize i am an asshole but it was out of pure awkwardness and panic. i get out into the parking lot and drive off, with only one coffee in hand. so yeah, next time i go for coffee break, i don't think i will choose that place because they will have realized what i did and probably think i'm the world's biggest ass hole.","spilt iced coffee all over starbucks kiosk in stop and shop, escaped, and now i am the coffee asshole."

over the week i wasn't able to  find a decent gift that i thought would be liked so planned on sending a card or e-card. though with a research project i am a part of at my college, my week and weekend was spent doing work on it, and due to horrible cell signals in the research lab, wasn't able to call.

mom gets pissed as my brother completely forgot as well, won't talk to either of us, which don't blame her for.

613,"i had been hanging out with a friend of mine friday night, and ended up driving his sister and cousin into the valley (clubbing suburb) so i didn't get home until about 1030 and i had work the next morning. i was just about to go to bed when another friend called and asked if i wanted to join them at the local pub for last drinks.

stupidly i accepted. i walked to the pub, had a drink and a few smokes then went back to his place for some more drinks. i got very drunk there in a short period of time, then he brought out the bottle of tequila and poured everybody shots. being the idiot i am, i said ""i'll have the bottle!"" and polished off the three or four shots that were left in it.

i took my leave and walked home (it was about 130 now), felt a bit funny but i didn't think i'd had too much. got home, showered and lay down in bed. about ten seconds later it hit me, i leapt out of bed, sprinted into the bathroom, grabbed the toilet seat...


and threw up all over it. the toilet was covered and it was all over the walls. luckily i barely got any on myself, so i cleaned up and went to bed.

called in sick the next day, then went back to sleep. mum came in about ten and woke me up, saying she thought i had work this morning. i told her i had called in sick, and that i had to go clean my toilet.

""oh it's ok, i already cleaned it""

i felt so bad for her :(","drank too much, powerchugged all over my toilet, mum cleaned it up"
614,"my sister and i are about the same age. she lives in georia with her husband; i live in new york with my wife. before that my sister and i had moved around and hadn't seen much of each other for awhile; and we had never really been close. 
she always wanted us to be close i guess, but she has this just, weird kind of personality. every now and again she or i will give each other an awkward phone call, but we have way different values, and it's kind of like talking to a stranger that you're obligated to know.
her husband works at a church, and they're actively christian people. my wife and i haven't been to church in quite some time, and we aren't really bothered by that. though we do maintain our friendships with people we knew from church, it just isn't a priority to us any more, and i'm now agnostic.

i woke up this morning to a message from my sister, we'll call her dana. it was the obligatory, quarterly ""hey, how are you, and things?"" call, and now i had to call her back. hoping this wouldn't take too long i grabbed my hookah and began to set it up to smoke some weed; while i called her on speaker phone. 
she picked up and we started off with the usual dance of trite bullshit. how were things? how's the new place? what are you doing now? have you talked to mom or dad? you get the gist. in the course of this conversation i've got the coal going and am toking away, the conversation is winding down. just as i think we're about to hang up she drops this bomb: ""did you hear that dad hasn't paid his taxes for several years, and they might lose the house?"" 

holy fucking shit! i had not heard that! and i was way too high to suppress much gossip-killing indifference. my solution? finish this bowl, this is gonna be good! this conversation lead into a general critique of my dad, as he was a pastor, and my sister wanted him to stop doing that since it's an hour away both ways. then we went into churches and she asked me why i hadn't been going. ""unless you're agnostic now,"" she said half-jokingly. ""oh, well, uhhh...yeah, kinda,"" i half-joked back; too high to realize the consequences of that terrible phrase.

""what? well, you know god is real. so, what's the problem?""
*oh, shit.*
""well, uh, i just don't really care any more. i mean, he might be real, but i don't think he interacts with humanity anymore. i'm, like a deist.""
""but, he's either real or he isn't.""
""look, i just don't think it's important any more.""
""but, uncouthbastard, you went to bible school, you were a missionary.""
......

we went around in this circle for what felt like hours. i stumbled through the second half of our conversation, trailing off, forgetting what was being said, sounding high as fuck; while trying to explain why i just didn't care about god any more.

finally i just said, ""look i don't want to talk about this anymore."" 
""okay...""
we sat in silence on the phone still, for at least a minute.
""so, so, is there anything else you wanted to ask about?"" i was trying to end it.
""well, you just said you don't want to talk about it.""
*sigh* ""anything else?""
""no, not really.""
another minute of silence.
""okay, so, i guess, have a good afternoon.""
""okay you too.""

we hung up in a super awkward way.
this is going to be a huge family scandal when it gets back to my parents. they are going to make me hate my life, badgering me about why i've left the church.

edit: in reading over many of the comments here, and re-reading my initial post, i've come to realize that this story was really less about me and my family not having cohesive religious beliefs and them rejecting me; and more about how i (guess i fucked up?) realized that i'm getting older, and i don't have many very close friends, and it's weird and a little scary that my relationships are changing with old friends and family.",i told my awkward sister i'm not a christian anymore and she's going to tell my fundie parents and we're going to have phone time intervention. then i got hit with a nostalgia wave.
615,"this story happened years ago, but i figured tifu would enjoy it. this happened before reddit was even a thing.

i was 19 (almost 26 now) and an avid churchgoer and superchristian. i played guitar at my local church of about 1000 people. i had previously played guitar in the youth department of our church before being promoted to sunday service. while in youth, i met a kid named nick. nick was 15, and he and i were the same height and stuff. i had recently made a myspace bulletin about wanting a pair of heelys because i thought they were the coolest damn thing on the planet. i was not only a megachristian, but a megavirgin at this point, and apparently i wanted to remain so for a very long time by taking up such a useless and childish skill such as ""heeling."" so nick approached me after sunday service one day, and informs me that he has something to give me. it was the very pair of heelys that i so desired. the ones i had lusted after online, the ones i had practically made love to at the local journey's. they were mine. once i had returned to my humble abode after a food stuffing period, i slapped those bitches on and immediately found out that newton was correct in his hypothesis that a heavier object with much more mass than an apple will fall much faster than said apple. so, after two or three hours spent acquiring new cuts and bruises, i went inside.

the next day is where the story takes a turn for the worse. i decided, being off of work and school this next day, that i would spend time learning how to use my newfound transportation. i strapped those bitches on and headed to my street. i did decently for the first few runs. this is where shit gets fucked up. my road in front of my house is not paved, nay, it is rough grade asphalt. rough grade asphalt tends to produce errant rocks made of a strong material that cannot be of this earth. i call this element ""you'regonnadie rock."" i hit one of these unobtanium pebbles with as much force as a 245 lb, 5'9"" grown man can possibly generate. i managed to fall over my right leg, and was instantly gripped by the most blinding, sense nullifying pain imaginable. now, i didn't freak out at this point. let me clarify by saying i am a very clumsy and awkward person, as bigger people like myself are wont to be. i had sprained both of my ankles by jumping (story for another day) one year prior to this incident. i figured it was just a sprain, and as such would be wrapped up and be better in a few weeks. i was horribly mistaken.

i walked on this leg the next day. i started to notice some slight bruising, not on the spot where the pain was concentrated nay, further up my leg. two weeks later, i am on the couch in my living room unable to move for the fear that the blinding pain i was in would become much worse. the bruising on my leg had grown to 4 patches of reddish-black over my whole leg. i immediately went to the local hospital, and was informed that i had one of the worst fibular fractures the doctor had ever seen. my fibula was split in half and dislocated. had i come in right when the injury was sustained, i would have had a cast and been fine in 6 weeks. now, i was informed that my leg would require surgery. fuck. i have no insurance. none.

i go to the local trauma center, as they are the only ones that will perform said surgery without insurance. the surgery was free, and their case managers got me on state insurance for my follow-ups and pt. i was fixed, and they sent me home with 2.5 extra pounds of metal in my leg in the form of a plate and 7 screws. i went home after two days of sleep in a hospital bed thanks to the morphine they were so fond of giving me in an effort to placate me into not attacking my pt coach who kept awakening me and attempting to teach me how to use my crutches by climbing down a spiral flight of stairs. every time they would take me to the stairs, i would throw down my crutches, sit down on the ground, and begin to unleash a string of curses at this lady that literally made my mother cry. (i was fucked up on morphine, these stories were all told to me after the fact by my parents, grandparents, and great grandmother, who were all present as well.) so, i'm home in a surgical wrap, and getting fed hydrocodone every 4 hours to stave off the burning pain of my new bionic parts.

a few days after the surgery, i was going through my normal shower routine, when the plastic bag attached to my surgical wrap loosed itself from my person. the water instantly flooded into my wrap and soaked it thoroughly. well, fuck. a few days later, on top of the pulsing pain of the metal parts attached to my bone, i also now had burning pain on the surface of my incision. off again to the local hospital. they unwrapped my leg and there presented to me was one of the worst infected incisions i have seen in my short life, made worse and more gruesome by the fact that it was upon my person. the er doctor gave me some antibiotics, and then re-wrapped my leg. 

i ended up being fine. 

for then.

see, when you don't take enough antibiotics to get completely rid of the infection, you can develop an infection known the world over as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus. mrsa. several months later, i was walking again and all healed, and had been developing pus-filled nodules periodically. i had one under my arm when i went in to get my wisdom teeth pulled. this big, plum sized bastard instantly became very aggressive after being presented with the iv tranquilizer the orthodontist had given me. he decided that it was his body, not mine, and he wanted me gone. he proceeded to replace my blood with the diseased sludge that filled his pocket of inflamed adipose tissue. after returning home and recovering for one day, i was well enough to play at church on a wednesday night in preparation for our biggest event of the year: our yearly choir concert. afterwards, my mom and i joined some friends from the youth group in some post-church revelry at ihop. i began not feeling well, and as such, had my mother drive me home. upon arriving, i instantly went to bed. my mother had a moderate amount of difficulty awakening me the next morning. i decided i'd stay home from computer school to get better from the bug i decided that i was infected with. my mother came home to check on me at lunch, and this is where shit gets serious. she wakes me up by violently shaking me in bed, and informs me that my temperature was 104 degrees fahrenheit. i made it through hearing ""1-0..."" before i had collapsed on the floor next to my bed. my mother lifts me up with my arm on her shoulder, and takes me to her car. i start to come around on the way to the local hospital, with which i had become very well acquainted over the last few months. i passed out in triage, but only after having discovered that my temperature had climbed to a life-threatening 106 degrees and that my blood pressure had bitched out and decided to shrink to a measly 60/30. i was rushed to a bed unconscious, and remained so for a 2 day stay in the icu, of which i remember naught, and then 6 more days on the med/surg floor of the hospital receiving iv antibiotics, and learning that i was pretty much patient zero for mrsa in this area. i got my arm cut open and drained, and then i was well and able to return to school.

 

this is my first of many stories from my life. if you stayed until the end, i thank you and here's a bonus: you're a really cool person.","i broke my leg, surgical incision got infected, and then i almost died months later from said infection."

some of you may have ran into the posting of a young man that lived through the agony of shaving the hairs on his ass some time ago. i only ran across that post after having tried it myself and wanting to see if there was some way to get over the agony and utter despair of having a hairless ass. but first some background.

the act:

i am a hairy guy. i'm talking werewolf meets a parody of a jew sunbathing amount of hair. below my ass is not that bad but on my ass and above it is a dense, dank forest. i have so much of it that i was getting heat rashes in my armpits from the sweat and dirt that built up under the matted layers of hair and it was then that i went to my doctor and she advised me to 'cut some down', which i took as shave off. i mark this as the seminal moment of my adolescence, and let me tell you, dear reader, like kramer told jerry, 'once you start... you cannot stop'. i now understand how the mind of a serial killer works, it's gradualism. you start with fantasizing and it feels good, and the urge builds up, maybe you kill a defenseless animal, and that simmering urge becomes a burning desire, until you act, and you cannot stop yourself because the feeling is pure bliss. and thus i went from shaving my armpits, to shaving my chest, and then from there my arms, until i had not a drop of hair from the bottom of my jaw to the top of my shaft, and everything was oh so smooth and felt so good and then the ladies... the ladies loved it. i even began to trim the shaft and my testicles and became quite proficient at it. then one day, as i was exiting the shower, i caught a feint glimpse of my bare figure and noticed that there was... an impropriety. my top half was clean shaven, radiant even and of course my leg hair was not as thick, but my ass, that one final unshaven frontier was an oddity. albeit one that i quickly rectified using my electric razor. consequences would never be the same...

the aftermath:

i will simply state this once: never, ever, under any circumstances, shave the hair off of you ass.

after about 6 hours, my ass started to itch. i scratched, however, and gained no satisfaction. in fact, that made things worse. i developed small pimple like rashes that oozed blood and needed constant scratching to relieve the pain and that kept re-aggrivating themselves whenever i put on clothes. i started to believe in god because i now know that he created hair and put it on our ass because of friction. by the way, fuck friction, fuck it... fuck it. i cried, i contemplated suicide. i asked the god who i now believed in why? was i an unrighteous man? it hurt when i stood up, it hurt when i sat down, it hurt in the night, it hurt in the day. i slept on my stomach with no covers over my ass for weeks, because the irritation was so bad. at work i could sit in my chair but only at a certain angle and i could not adjust myself or risk opening the rashes and constant itching. i walked like an old, decrepit man so that i would not open the rashes. there was no solace, no peace even when i was 'relaxing' i was in constant agony and scratching every few minutes. in all, it took me approximately 8 weeks to grow my hair back and i made this post now, with my throwaway, because i can only laugh now that i have returned to normal.

2 weeks into it, i got pretty comfy, and, when getting ready for work in a haste at the crack of dawn, i threw stuff out of my backpack on the floor.... (and amongst the ""stuff"" there were some toys that would make you blush. seriously, some kinky-@$$ sh!t. like a bunch of vibrators. and a 16'' double-dildo (what? they are easier to grip) and way, way more).

playing goalie shouts to me, ""hey, 100 bucks if you can score on me from there!"". i
played a lot of soccer in my younger years, so i know it's within my range. he was playing way
off the line so i just had to get it over his head. so i start taking my steps to the ball,

i yell ""fuck!!!"" in excruciating pain, open my eyes, and realize i was still in my bed, dreaming.

monday night, i realized it'd been over a week since i'd gone out drinking, so i figured, ""hey, i don't have class until noon tomorrow, why not go out and get drunk with my little in my fraternity?"" so i went to do just that, but most of the bars were completely empty or wouldn't take my little's international id. so we decided to grab some fireball whiskey from his room and drink back at my house. we were just drinking it completely straight, because it tastes delicious and really doesn't need a mixer. i thought all was fine. 

i went to bed and woke up around 11am with the overwhelming urge to shit. i swear to god the next twenty minutes were some of the worst minutes of my life. it felt like someone had literally taken a blowtorch to my asshole and held it there. i was crying and painfully shitting out liquid fire through my poor, torn asshole. i finished and proceeded to skip class and cry in my bed for an hour straight.

 

edit: if this frontpages, i will probably delete it. people in my fraternity are on reddit and they probably would recognize this was me by the story.

edit2: whatever, i don't care if my brothers see this. haha. for the record, i'm a gay male and i usually drink a bit classier alcohol.

edit3: tifu by getting to the front page. i really hope someone fucks up a lot worse this week so i don't end up as fotw... haha. also, to all of you giving tips for easier anal sex, i really appreciate it. i'm usually a top though and i followed all the steps i take with guys that bottom for me (at least fifteen minutes of anal play using fingers/toys before attempting anything, going slow, going on top and sitting down on it, etc.), but i think because i was nervous i subconsciously was closing off. but anyway, thanks for your concern for my well-being! my butthole feels much better today. :)",don't mix fire and torn anuses.
624,"christ, i'm not sure i can look at him the same way again ahahaha. i wasn't even snooping on his computer, i've never used his let alone look at his browser history or anything.

about a year ago i showed him a picture of a funny reaction gif, he thought it was hilarious and asked where i found it. i told him whenever i see a funny gif i put it in my gifs bookmark folder. we spent a good half hour just trawling through my amusing gifs, great times. he asked if i could send him all the bookmarks.

i figured the easiest way to do this would be for him to log into his google account on my laptop and then copy my gifs folder into his bookmarks.

the unintended consequence of this was that our bookmarks folders synced across both accounts. no biggie, his bookmarks were just a load of lol strategy guides and gaming related shit. i deleted them from my bookmarks, and forgot about everything.

fast forward almost a year...to today.

i've recently discovered the joys of dashlane password manager. so today i install it on my laptop, and it pops up with a warning about storing unencrypted passwords in your browser. this came as a surprise, because i never save passwords in my browser, precisely because i don't think its secure. today i completely vindicated that belief. in the process of swapping those bookmarks a year ago, i also accidentally swapped every single password stored on my housemates google account, which dashlane handily listed in alphabetical order. 

gay porn, transexual porn, furry porn, futanari, hentai, all the weird shit. dashlane listed his logins to every single weird porn site he was subscribed to, all registered to his personal email account.",do not use your personal email for naughty things.
625,"it was actually saturday/sunday night. i was at this local club party when suddenly i realized a girl dancing in front of me is watching me a lot. as time passes i started like trying to start a conversation but it was difficult because of the loud music. she started to get closer and closer until was basically dancing with me, one thing to another and we started kissing.

one of the guys i was with (he doesn't know my friend) took a couple of pictures and send them to a whatsapp group i'm in, but a friend of mine resend it to another group where my friend is. as soon as he saw the picture he recognized her sister. i knew he had a sister but i had never seen her, and i had no clue that she was my friend's sister, although i have a small suspicious that she knew who i was.

i think my friend ain't that mad but i don't know for sure, i just hopes this doesn't fucks up anything.

i know for some people this ain't a big thing, and well i really don't care who my sister hooks up with, but lots of people, almost all of my friends, are very protective about their sisters.",hooked up with a friend's sister without knowing. he knew about it because of a picture.
626,"i went to bed at 2 am (due to reddit) and woke up at 5:50 am to go to school, so i was very tired. when i was brushing my teeth, a big glob of toothpaste fell out of the tube and onto my hand. due to my tired state, i didn't notice it until it was too late. after my teeth were brushed, i ran my hand through my hair a few times to get rid of the bed-head look. i did not realize that i had spead colgate all over my lushious locks. later in the day i (attempted) to run my hand through my hair, and i was greeted by a helmet of hair harder than a spartan helm. at that moment i realized that i smelled like a walking toothpaste tube for the entire morning, and washed my hair in the bathroom. so then i continued the day looking like a washed up sailor, who smelled like toothpaste.",i rubbed fallen toothpaste in my hair. the results were a helmet of hair and a minty aroma.
627,"this is another one of those tifus that actually happened a few months ago, but i didn't feel ready to re-visit this escapade until i'd moved out of my family home.

so for a good 3 days in the summer i had been eating nothing but homemade nachos, which is basically just shitloads of cheddar cheese grated on top of tortilla chips. obviously something so delicious in such abundance is going to have its consequences, and i discovered what this was all too soon

the night after this 3 day binge i woke up with constipation for the first time, and it is the most severe pain i have ever encountered. it felt like there was antimatter up my arse. it was so bad i had tears in my eyes for the rest of the night. 

anyway, day came (as it does, thanks sun !) so i trotted down to the shop and bought myself a bar of exlax laxative chocolate. i tried a square and it was absolutely delicious, so i merrily ate the whole bar, believing this to be the dosage one is to consume. 

i then thought ""hey, i know ! i'll have a look at the instructions""

jesus.fucking.christ

""eat one square before bed time and allow exlax to work overnight""

it's 2pm and i've eaten a bar that consists of 12 squares. i run upstairs and try to make myself vom it up, but no joy, at this early stage it's already too late. i have no choice but to wait it out. so i go downstairs, pale as a sheet and decide to watch the olympic games for a few hours while i wait for the inevitable to happen. and by god does it happen.

at around 8pm the apocalypse strikes. the vietnam war is about to launch itself out of my arse and there is absolutely nothing i can do about it, so i sprint upstairs to the bathroom ( a room i now realize i should have reserved for the entirety of the day, thanks captain hindsight !). i turn the handle but it doesn't budge, the door is locked. i bang on the door and plea to be let in, only to hear my grumpy teenage brother respond ""i'm in the baaath, go awaaaaay"". i explain to him that i really need to come in and he tells me to fuck off again. oh dear. 

i do a little panicky dance that resembles that of wallace when he realizes that he's forgotten the crackers, and then realise that there is only one thing i can do. i lower my shoulder and charge at the door, luckily my mum fitted the lock so it broke off with minimal effort. 
""what the fuck are you doing !? "" yells my rather startled brother
""just look away "" i beg "" i'm sorry, but just, just look away ! "" i scream as i pull down my trousers. before my brother has had a chance to look away and before i've had a chance to fully sit down, a liquid jet of brown substance launches from my anus and paints the back of the toilet, the noise is horrible.  the sight of his older brother jettisoning 3 days of digested nachos all over the bathroom and the smell that accompanies is , understandably, fairly overwhelming for the poor boy, and he launched a rather stellar vom-bomb all over the bath and himself. this in turn makes me feel quite unwell and i chunder all over the bathroom floor. i then sit back down and sob while my poor brother screams in terror at what has just occurred. 

clean-up was hell as you can imagine, and my brother hasn't been the same since, we haven't really spoken of the event as i don't think he's going to be able to laugh at it for quite some time. hopefully you guys will though !",overdosed on laxatives and shat in front of my brother who in turn threw up all over himself.
628,"just to set the stage, me and my friend (who was bitching about his throat) were walking home from a late night 7/11 trip and on the way home this lady with her baby needed to use my phone to call the police on her abusive boyfriend. so she did and then the police came.

so me and him were standing there watching the whole thing unfold and he said ""im going to go over and ask them to look at me."" he started to walk over there and i said ""don't do that your fine, and besides there checking out the lady who is actually hurt."" so we waited more and the ambulance with the lady and baby left and as soon as they left my friend ran over to the chief of police's car and started talking to him. i went over there my friend said they called an ambulance for him and i had no words for his bitchiness so i just waited with him. the ambulance came and the medics were looking at him and they said they had to take them to the hospital. then he tried to convince them not to take him but he is a minor and he didn't have a choice and they left with him.

i then continued on home laughing my ass off because it was funny at the time and then he called me basically crying. he said he need a ride because they wouldn't let him leave without a ride so he begged me to pick him up. i gave in once he said he would pay for gas a full tank of gas and i would get him in and hour once the sun came up (im only 16, i got my license but i still can't drive when it's dark). so i went and got him from the hospital about 30 miles away and he paid for the gas and i started to take him home. then it turns out he didn't even get his throat checked and it was still bugging him! so when i dropped him off i honked the horn so it would wake up his parents and it did and he got yelled at.",i let my friend be a huge bitch and caused me to waist my night.
629,"i work at a somewhat small marketing firm, my cubicle is in the far end and no one is around me. today was a slow day, and i was having one of those horny times

so anyway, i set my phone to vibrate and put it between my thigh and squeeze. midway through the thing my boss shows up and starts talking about some ideas for a project we're working on

i couldn't just remove the phone, i'd have to either take it out, or open my legs letting it fall... both options would expose what i was doing. and he stood there for a while

the tension kept building up, and the thought that i was pleasuring myself in front of a stranger who's clueless to it didn't help... i tried to hold it, but normally i don't let the vibration go that long... i started sweating, my voice and breath got heavy, and i started squirming a bit

my boss asked if i was ok, i told him it was just cramps... at which point he had a look as if he figured what was really going on, said he'll back later and left

i let some moments pass to make sure he was far enough, then i fell on the floor and had an orgasmic seizure... it was the most intense climax i've ever had... then i started feeling like shit, and i'm terrified. i don't know if he really knew, or what he thinks. he respects me and likes my work & efforts... and i might have just destroyed all that :(

**update**: 

- i was not expecting this to escalate this fast. i knew reddit loved vagina stories, but i didn't know it loved it *that* much!

- i've thought about it after i've calmed down, and i guess i don't have anything to worry about

- what i did was a mistake, there's the reason i've posted in /r/tifu not /r/yaythisisawesomeimdoingthisforfunsies or made it sound hot and posted in /r/gonewildstories

- some people are saying it's fake, ""dear penthouse"", /r/thathappened... whatever! i didn't send it to get approvals, i just needed support, which some have given (thanks)

- no one is getting any promotions or special treatments because of this. grow up, it's not high school

- about 80% of reddit is immature... and not just in the way of ""oh, he's just a teenager"". some are full grown adults and they still don't act like it. also, about the same percentage don't know anything about the female body and how it works

- i didn't mean for this to get this high upvoted. while it's nice to get to the front page, this is not the ""thing"" that i want to remember front paged me. also, the problem with high upvoted posts is that they attract a lot of people. they start nice (because they want to give their input honestly), but then end with ugly comments and hurtful ones. most of the comments are good, but still the bad ones that i keep getting (increasingly) through my inbox hurt very bad

- you think it goes without saying, it's common knowledge, but like jane told jesse: dbaa. or as luke shapiro told dr. squires: there's enough assholes in this world, don't be another one",: tifu by sticking my vibrating mobile between my thighs and having an orgasm while my boss was talking to me
630,"first i need to explain a few things. i'm currently a guest in a house that is off grid for water and gas and has expensive electricity. i'm staying in a little guest house that gets rainwater pumped in from the main house...the pump being situated above the master bedroom.

i woke up around 2am needing to use the toilet. i took a piss and figured i'd flush it in the morning. as i was heading back to bed i remembered i hadn't brushed my teeth so i walked back and started brushing. i must add it was pretty dark as i hadn't turned the strip lighting on. i get to the point i need to spit and rinse the brush midway through and with a spark of inspiration remember i have bottles of water lying around the place. i grab the nearest one and pour roughly where the brush is...you know, in relation to my hands. had i been more awake i may have noticed the eerily quiet flow of the 'water' but it was only after sticking the brush back in my mouth and starting back brushing the the taste hit my tongue.
i'm backpacking and so as to save space i poured what was left of my liquid detergent into an old water bottle.
the more i rinsed the worse it got (obviously), i grabbed my flannel and did some mouth scraping ...which worked ok actually. i had mouthwash but due to its bacteria killing properties i was forbidden from using it as it would kill the bacteria in the waste treatment underground container thingy. mouthwashed into a cup, cleaned off my toothbrush with a lot of hot water (at this point my considerations had gone out the window) and re brushed. took me a good 30-40 minutes to get  back to sleep after that.","sleepiness, strict water controls and detergent in mineral water bottles don't mix."
631,"side note: this happened back in the winter of 2004. this is just one of many embarrassing moments that i have experienced since.

back in 9th grade, there was a serious drug problem at my school… ex-lax and it’s “users” were running rampant through the hallways of my high school. i’m not exactly sure as to how many victims fell prey during the ex-lax saga, but i’m just glad that my little run in with the substance didn’t take place on school grounds. thankfully, i was drugged at an all guy sleep over. don’t judge me, i was in 9th grade. this was the year that i was introduced to both marijuana and ex-lax… 2004 was my 80′s.

as i was saying, two of my friends and i were crashing at one of our friend’s house. i’m not going to mention any names, but one of us had weed. even though ~~we~~ they may not partake in that activity anymore, weed was something that we felt the need to try. keep in mind, we were total fucking amateurs when it came to smoking pot. let’s just say that our smoking device consisted of a soda can. after poking about 20 pinholes in our poor man’s bowl, we trucked through a foot of snow towards our smoking destination. houston, we have lift off.

after a solid ten minute coughing spree, we made our way back to the family room. to my surprise, there was a plate of brownies waiting for us on the coffee table. not even 5 minutes after i sat my high ass down, a physical challenge was thrown my way. “hey bromemeoth, i bet you can’t eat three brownies in less than three minutes”. are you kidding me? that’s child’s play. as soon as i crushed brownie number two, the room erupted with laughter and finger pointing. fuck! those bastards finally got the kid who started the whole ex-lax epidemic. right then and there, my night turned into a waiting game.

seeing as my jeans were already soaked from the snow, i figured i might as well borrow a pair of sweatpants (and not wear any boxers under them… you know, just in case). hours passed, and nothing had happened. at this stage in the game, only two of us were awake. congratulations guys, the only thing i was feeling was gas—or so i thought. on a whim, i decided that i was entitled to rip ass in the face of one of the two sleeping beauties. after all, they did poison me with chocolate laxatives.

so there i was, pointing my ass at a face like it was a loaded gun, and you wouldn’t believe how quickly that simile turned into reality. as soon as i let that flatulent fly, i went from giggles to terror in a matter of milliseconds. that’s right, i just shit a pair of loaners (borrowed pants). not only that, but right in the face of one of the culprits involved. the only way that my shart story could have gotten any more embarrassing was if i would have bare-assed it. and believe you me, i was one bad decision away from doing just that.","got high, ate ex-lax, shit my friend's pants."
632,"so i'm currently on vacation in brazil and a friend of mine from my hometown in portugal also came here for a different reason, and we decided to hang out one night. there was a party yesterday and we decided to go there for some fun and drinks and stuff, so he asks me during the day to go buy some drinks.
later at night i show up with 2 bottles of vodka and 1 of juice and the four of us (his friends) start drinking before entering the party because we weren't allowed to bring outside drinks. his 2 friends didn't drink a hell of a lot so it turned out me and my friend drinking most of the stuff.
eventually we go in, and from there on i have no idea what happened, turns out i was so drunk that i could barely walk, i have no idea how i got out of the party, no idea how i got home, or how i payed the taxi driver that took me home, got inside the house, locked the door, put myself to bed or anything else.
i woke up all hungover (obviously) and now it turns out i apparently lost my glasses somewhere.","met a friend on vacation, got drunk at party, lost glasses!"
633,"i (m 15) live about a mile away from wendys, and decided to spend my friday afternoon with my friends. so we agreed on going and having a snack at wendys. started innocent enough right? so when we get there i get a classic, chocolate, frosty and and joking with my friends eat it with a plastic knife. we talked, laughed, and had a good time. eventually we had enough and decided it was time to head back, and we throw away our trash.. all except my plastic knife. now if you have ever tasted a plastic spoon you would know that for some reason that plastic lollipop is like candy! we were about halfway back, walking on the dirt path when i turn around for a second and to my surprise trip a bit. woah that was close, i almost died. so stupid me thinks it would be a god idea to keep this knife in my mouth and test my luck again. well you guessed it a couple feet later clumsy me trips in a random rock and down goes goodman. 1 hour later im at the hospital getting my torn up cheeck looked at. turns out having a knife shoved through your cheek isnt a seriously injury but i can tell you it was pretty serious to me!",learned that all knifes are evil and i'm smart
634,"this happened last night but i've had some kind of paralyzing shame until now.  my brother works at a sales job and the last friday of every month they have a big drink up at the bar near their office.  it's an open bar to pretty much anyone who says, ""oh yeah, i'm with the company.""  so i usually end up showing up and we hang out and get super drunk.  nothing in this world feels quite as amazing as getting sloppy for free.

this night my brother and i were being our usual jackass selves to each other: one of us would go grab a round of shots and chasers (usually the high life, we keep it classy).  and the jackassery is that we always try to get a worse shot than the last one.  so we went jack, don julio, lunazul, wild turkey (gobble gobble), old crow.  and a beer with each to boot.

it was at this point that it was my turn to go to the bar.  i order two shots of midori, which i thought would have won the game, to which a very cute girl says, ""double fisting, huh?  bold.""  or something to that effect.  i give her my most dapper smile and say, ""well god gave me two hands for a reason.""  it was around that time that my eyes made their customary once over of this girl's body, and it was a great body too, until they stopped very suddenly.

this girl only had one hand.

this girl, who i had actually met before at one of these drink ups, was born with one hand and one nub.  i stood there just shellshocked for a second and then went into super apologizer mode.  i did everything short of prostrating myself in front of her.  to my incredible luck, she had lived through 28 years of this sort of thing and was a very good sport about it.  i offered to buy her a drink and that eventually diffused the tension (open bar, remember), but the rest of the night, everyone who was within earshot looked at me like i was a damn serial killer.",i put this up here to make you think i'm considerate.  read the fucking story.
635,"i woke up this morning when my girlfriend was going to work.  she left the dorm room and i took it upon myself to rub one out.  my girlf doesn't like it when i jerk it and it makes her upset, so i was feeling guilty (even though she didn't know).  so i showered and then got ready for a meet-up i had with some classmates about a presentation we have to make tomorrow about france, belgium and the netherlands during the holocaust.  i was assigned the netherlands, in case you were wondering.  i was ready to go, when i realized i had about 10 minutes left until the meeting.  i beat my meat again.  i went to the meeting and one of the guys was late so it was just me and the other member of the group were just talking about what we were going to do for the presentation.  i was mid-sentence about anne frank or something when a load of cum slithered out of my dickhole and coiled up in the fibers of my loins.  it was difficult to keep a straight face when cum is just pouring out of one's dick.  i had to keep eye contact while i was doing it too.  i don't know my group member that well, which made it weirder.  anyway we stood talking while this gloopy pile of sperm was making itself home in my underpants for a while before the other guy turned up.  turns out neither of them had even begun the work while i was already done.  totally wasted my time.  this is what i get for masturbating instead of fucking my girlf.",the holocaust made me cum.
636,"so my grandparents, my mother, and i are sitting at the kitchen table enjoying some after-dinner tea when my grandpa gets a fabric tape measure and starts measuring his waist. he puts it on the table and i toy with it a little.

i decide to measure my own waist just for the hell of it and decide to see what else i could measure. it's not long enough to measure my height but i decide to measure my hand. now, perhaps my subconscious had my penis in mind (when does it not?) but i wasn't consciously thinking about *how* or *where* i was measuring my hand until i hear my grandpa ask ""what are you trying to measure there?""

at that point i realize that i'm measuring my hand right at my waist, with my wrist holding the tape against my body and my hand pointing outward. you know, kind of in a similar way to how my erect penis sticks out from my body when i'm aroused. standing right at the kitchen table in front of my mom, grandma, and grandpa (who is giving me an odd look).

i promptly try to pass it off like nothing by continuing to measure my arm and head.

side note: it turns out that's not a bad way to estimate the size of one's wang.",bad choice of measuring method makes my grandpa think i'm checking out my dick.
637,"i was going to the uk from brussels to visit some of my friends there for a week. what i had not planned on was the horrifying experience in going there...

my train was scheduled for departure at 10:58 in the morning. i was meeting a different friend of mine yesterday night for dinner, and one thing led to another, i got home wasted after an amazing night of beer, champagne and free drinks. it was around 04:00 when i got home.

i woke up from my alarm ringing at 07:00, and am immediately greeted by a impressive amount of vomit on my floor next to my bed (and of course, some parts on my bed). the splatter from it had hit my shoes, phone, trousers and shirt i was planning to wear. in my hungover state, i decided to shower before trying to deal with this. that went fine, but then the task of cleaning up half digested burger and fries, along with all the drinks was too much. i puke into my bucket which i have taken to carrying everywhere. feeling defeated, i just scoop up the rest and throw it in there, to then pour this down my toilet.

after some more clean-up and putting my sheets in the wash, i finally go downstairs to have breakfast. not feeling to well, i decide for cornflakes and yoghurt. i pour my bowl of cornflakes, only to discover there's no yoghurt in the fridge. i crumple into the human equivalent of a sack of potatoes and watch tv to pass some time (08:00 at this point). feeling myself getting worse, i get up and stumble to the toilet, to throw up whatever i had left in my stomach.  here is when i decided to take a nap to sleep some of my hangover away. i set a new alarm and lie down on the couch. 

some time later, i wake up and wonder how late it is considering my alarm hadn't gone off. i get up and check my phone, and **fuck, it's 11 o'clock**. i basically throw on my clothes, grab my bag and spring to the nearest cab stop. i jump in, tell him which station and hope to christ my train is delayed in some way (at this point i realize my hair has dried much like jimmy neutrons because of my nap).

train station. i go to the desk, pale as a sheet, and tell them my problem. i get told they eurostar desk can't help me, and to go to the main ticket desk. i get my number, and as i'm called up, explain my situation again. i'm propping myself up on my water bottle and look like i just jumped out of hospital from some fatal illness. she tell me that there's nothing i can do, but buy a new ticket and wait for the next train. as i couldn't get a refund for my previous ticket, i'm a little annoyed but there was no other option. one hundred and twelve euros. i groan and my head meets the desk. i guess she took pity on me because i told me she was able to get the price down to one hundred and five euros. great. so far, i've puked thrice, i look horrible, haven't eaten anything and am two hundred and seven euros poorer.

two hours pass. only minor incidents happen to me. then the check in opened. i get up, and slowly saunter past passport control. i make it to the x-ray machine, and the back of my neck starts sweating. i start salivating. i'm getting dizzy. i drop my bag and just sit down, between security checkpoints and stick my head between my knees. two guards ask if i'm alright, to which i can only reply, ""yeah, just hungover"".

eventually i make it through, and sit down. i make a trip to get a sandwich, and sit back down. twenty minutes pass, no new incidents. then boarding started. i got to my seat, and it happened again. the sweating. wet mouth. dizziness. i sit down. i'm too late. i puke a small amount over my right knee and into the little bin next to my seat. thankfully, it was nearly only water. but it wasn't over. i felt more rising. i get up and push my way past other people that are boarding and rip open the door to a toilet. i'm barely able to close the door before i start puking again. i get it all over the seat and floor. this time the recently eaten sandwich decided to come up. it was all over the floor. it is a vile sight and has an even worse smell.

i carefully look left and right, and get the fuck out of that toilet. i get out of there safely and manage to sit back down. no one is next to me, so i decide now i deserve some rest. i lie down, put my hood over my face and basically die.",i missed my train. and i puked everywhere. and lost a lot of money. i could have avoided all this if i had just stuck to my plan of getting dinner and going home.**
638,"i live in an apartment with two other people. my landlord will only allow one person to have their name on the lease for the apartment and will only accept rent from one person, which is me. so i have to get my rent money from my roommates and my roommates have no legal obligations.

i decided that i wanted to move out into my own place by myself. one of my roommates wants to leave at the end of august/july. i asked my other roommate if he wanted to take over the lease and get new roommates and he said he didn't want that responsibility (i've been on my lease since i was 19. he's 25.) so i told him i was still deciding if i was going to move out or not (in which case he would have to leave as well) and if so it would be the end of july or august. he immediately asked if he could call me later and talk about it, then i clued in that it's because he would like to move out asap if everyone else is moving out.

the problem with that is that he's not legally obligated to give me more than a months notice as to when he's moving out, and i have to give my landlord 3 months notice as to a move out date. my other roommate (one moving out at the end of the summer) is not legally obligated to pay the portion of rent that the other guy leaves if he leaves early, leaving me to pay his share for the 3-4 months left before moving out.","roommate bailing on rent, my name is the only name on the lease, thus i have to pay his share."
639,"this was actually last night. i was at a slightly stoopid concert, and my friend and i had just finished some 40's and some tree. i was groovin' so hard to the music i just needed someone to dance with. i see two blondes move in front of me. they looked good from behind, and i got a glimpse of their faces and they looked pretty hot. i try dancing with one, and she wasn't into it. a few minutes later i start dancing with the other and she got pretty into it grinding on me. she kept looking back and giggling. i couldn't figure out what the fuck was going on. after a few songs we started talking a little more, and i asked where she went to school. she giggled real hard and said "" i don't go to school hun"". i got a better look at her face, and realized she was old enough to be my mother. she said "" thanks for that, that was fun"". she was still pretty hot. 

edit: to clarify, the ""fuck up"" was the fact that i didn't realize how old she was at first. i'm not saying it's a bad thing.",i was drunk and stoned at a concert. danced with a hot girl (who i thought was my age) who turned out to be a milf.
640,"so i met up with a horny lady friend on the interwebs. house is occupied so we decided that it was all fine to fuck in my coupe vehicle. we shared some bubbles and then went at it on the passenger seat. things started to get so hot that i had to open the door, as the car was full of condensation and such. damn car makes a beeping noise when the doors open and the keys are in the ignition, so i switched the key to the accessory position - didn't think much of it. bucket loads of sweat was extracted all over each other, dripping into the seatback.

later that evening after dropping her off, i noticed the srs light on my dash. damn, must have shaken the car too much and tripped the incident meter. i googled around and contacted the local specialist to visit me the following day while at work to sort it out.

well, today he turned up and hooked his computer into my dash. 
him: ""hmm... looks like theres a reported fault with the sensor"". 
me: ""oh, yeah. damn thing's played up in the past. what's it say?""
him: ""it's reporting a fault with the sensor in the passenger seat.""
me"" ""um... yeah i was moving some stuff in my car in the weekend"".
him: ""oh, it says here the liquid submersion indicators were set off. did you get the seats wet?""
me: *blushing* ""um... yeah i also cleaned my car. perhaps i wet the seat. ooops."".

$80 later and he's reset my system, and told me that in the future if i'm moving things about or cleaning to turn my ignition off to not trip the sensors.","if you're going to fuck in your modern srs-equipped car, turn the ignition off or you're going to have a bad time. or fuck on the back seats."
641,"today, for the first time since october i decided to go for a run, and try to get back in shape. it was a pretty good run, however my right thigh really cramped up after i got back. after trying to bear it four a couple hours, i finally decided to do something about it. i grabbed the ""icy-hot"" (a sort of pain relief) cream i often use when my back is sore, and put it right where it hurt the most, the innermost part of my thigh. after standing up and taking a couple steps i realized my blunder, the still wet cream rubbed up against my balls, its been three hours, and my testes are still burning.","put pain relief cream on my leg, ended up getting it on my balls.**"
642,"i am in grad school to finish my masters of social work degree.  i am scheduled to finish up in the spring.  but, i have to complete an internship during my final semester.  it's 450 hours spread out over 16 weeks.  it's hellish when working full-time.  i did it once, and basically there's no way i can do it again.

so, my plan was to go on leave at my current job.  this would allow me to balance the internship and school work while not dying from exhaustion.  it's great too, because my house is on the market and might sell by mid january.  this means i'd have no rent (i am staying with my father in law) and can float my bills much more easily.

well, here's where i fuck up.  remember that job i was mentioning?  i've been working 12-13 hour days.  every day.  since september.  i just got an email from the field office telling me that they were ""concerned for my field readiness"" as i had not completed the required training session this past weekend.  fuck.  this training happens once per semester and i've heard that they have turned down students from entering field when they miss it.  awesome.  my job thinks that i'm quitting (as they just denied my request for leave and pto).  and, that safety net that i potentially built up with the sale of my house?  worthless.  thanks, career point!",i missed a required training for an internship and now i probably cannot finish school in the spring.  i have already gone through the motions to quit my job and had a great plan to have almost no expenses while in the internship...and that is gone.
643,"i bombed the final. 

the worst part is that i have a job lined up for january 13th and now i have to tell my boss about the fuck up and maybe have my offer declined. 

fuck.

edit: things turned out decently. i did an internship this semester that i'm going to get to retroactively count for credit. i will graduate from college without taking any additional classes. i told my boss at work and he told me that he liked my integrity and honesty for coming clean about it and having a plan to recover. the job and salary are still on the table regardless of my degree. 

more on the reason i failed: the professor is an extremely hard grader with no teaching ability to merit it. the average % in the class was a 58. i got a 54, and he would not bump me up. every professor in the department knows that him and one other professor are terrible, but they can't be pushed out. my overall gpa, even with the d is a 3.4 (i only lost about .06 points because of it). this semester, i also got a b in a graduate level class with a foundation in high-level mathematics and completed two project based classes with a's, one from the best/most challenging professor in the department. sure, maybe i could have studied more, but this professor isn't free of blame on this part.","managed to not lose my job offer or starting salary, i'll graduate next semester. working hard and being honest about mistakes helped me recover."
644,"no, i didn't shit myself, but it wasn't loads better.

got on the bus on the way home from lectures at uni with friends from my course. the bus is full so i'm standing which is fine, though it's in one of the more open sections of the standing area so i need to reach up for the rings to hold on to. which is also fine.

at this point i should also mention that it's the last day of lectures and a big programming project hand in day, so i am knackered. i am also a big guy, and of my skills good balance isn't one of them.

deciding that i might fall over if i remain hanging onto the rings, i decide to reach for a pole a couple of feet away. as i do so the bus goes round a corner and i lose my balance. it takes me a while to properly lose it though, so there were a good five-ten seconds where i knew i was going to fall on someone, but wasn't yet in a position to apologise profusely.

inevitably i fall, and the student, middle-aged woman and old man seem reasonably ok with the situation. i feel like a tit. i stand up to see a friend of a friend absolutely pissing herself with laughter, trying to do it subtly. my friends pretended not to notice at the time, but between the lot of them i'm not going to hear the end of it. or get that bus again.

at least i didn't shit myself.","big guy falls on people on a bus, people see, mock him, no one shits themselves. sounds far less dramatic or entertaining than the full version."
645,"so today, my coworker at a tech company asked me to help him set up a second database for one of our apps.    
   
him: ""i've been working with 'app' for a while now. i've been working hard on making the data in it really great for demos, i just need a second version of 'app' for dicking around with development work.""  

me: ""ok great! i've done this before, i'll help you set it up!""  

45 minutes later.  

me: ""ok that was harder than i thought it would be, but this new instance of app seems to be working! try bringing up your original app to make sure it still works! :d""  

original version of app comes up.... no data!  

us: (◉︵◉) (◉︵◉)

i am going to buy him a cake tomorrow.

*edit:* also i shit my pants via shart by accident at work last week but i didn't feel like making a throwaway account, but might as well share that tidbit too",** today i fucked up and i feel really bad about it. i lost a lot of his work and he works really hard.
646,"i'm positing this under a throw-away, because i don't want to make anyone else feel badly...

after thanksgiving, i was feeling so grateful and blessed by all we had. no real savings, but no huge debt either, and enough to pay the bills. i was looking forward to extra work hours and a bonus on my december 15th check, so i decided to help other people out. toys for tots, the foster system toy drive, the local food drive, and another family on reddit that were having a tough time all got hundred dollar donations. i finished my christmas shopping for family, signed up for reddit secret santa, paid all the monthly bills.... and then came down with influenza. 

the 'flu is no joke. i was flat out for a week, and i missed 8 days of work. during the busy season, the working of which is what *earns* that holiday bonus. that, plus two doctor visits and a prescription of tamiflu, and i am down a cool $1000 from my ""projected budget."" with $90 bucks left until january 1st. 

so my husband and i are trying to return the gifts we got for each other in time to buy groceries. i'm returning a couple of things i got for my daughter as well. 

being an elf is a wonderful thing....but planning ahead and being frugal would have been better. next year, i'll start saving early so i have money to share that doesn't hinge on my ""projected"" paycheck. oops.","santa's elves' kids have few toys of their own, like the cobbler's kids who have no shoes."
647,"today i said a sexist comment about how women right were a joke since we were talking about rights in social class so i got the death stare from this one girl who has a mighty wraith and i thought she was going to kill me. i was apologizing  to everyone in my class and tried explaining it was a joke from somewhere. also i'm not a sexist male i think male and females should have equal rights. 

 

sorry for the spelling mistakes i try to improve on it.",made sexist joke in a room full of grade 9ers.
648,"i stayed up all night last night because i needed to catch up on a really important controlled assessment that i was behind on. this means that at school i was exhausted. unfortunately i had a french test the same day, and, seeing as i slept through half of it, i'm not expecting a great mark. 

so as soon as i got home from school, i had a shower, got dried, and went downstairs to relax and go on reddit. turns out i fell asleep at some point. this would not usually have been a problem, but when i woke up my laptop had been restarted.

when i logged back into my laptop, i checked my history and i saw that the last thing i had been browsing was /r/wtf. i opened the last link that i viewed on it in my semi-conscious state, and, to my horror, it was an imgur album with pictures of a man branding the head of his penis.

i am 99% sure that at least one of my parents saw my the screen of my laptop whilst i was asleep, so of course it doesn't really look amazing at this point, because my dad implied that i should be more careful about what i'm viewing online. hopefully he just said this as a general tip   because i guess there's the possibility of my laptop having restarted *before* he got the chance to see my screen, as long as i drowsily pressed space when [this cunt](http://i.imgur.com/j4y72cy.png) showed up (pressing space will select the option highlighted automatically, which, in this case, is ""restart now"") - although it is very wishful thinking. i have no idea how my laptop could have been restarted otherwise though.

so now, not only am i behind on my revision for my big controlled assessment in a few hours which i won't be able to concentrate on anyway, but my parents may also think i am into genital mutilation.

649,"so my family has an atrocious way of dealing with all things culinary. all of it.

the house is pretty big, so when people go off on their way with dishes... sometimes those dishes don't get back all that quickly to the kitchen. i myself have to deal with 3 flights of stairs to get to a sink. **i can't have it piling up in my room** 2 plates max. who really wants to be so gross as to make multiple trips to get dirty dishes from one level of the house to wash them?

i'll tell you who. people that i'm related to by blood.

i had found this double bagged 80liter garbage bag by the stairs full of dirty cups, cutlery and plates/bowls. i'm talking 30 plates a handful of glass, cups and all that. just sitting there waiting for one of the guys to haul it down. it was a good 40 lbs of it.

3 months of dishes. 3 months. yes, we've got a looooot of dishes. it's weird don't ask. the family can't grasp the concept of a set.

my dad would be the one to either hand scrub them or cart them in the dishwasher. who the fuck wants another human being to deal with that after working 10 hours in a lumber yard? not me. i was furious.

so i did what comes to me naturally. i brought it downstairs to the garage, found a heavy object, and wailed on that garbage bag till every single one of those dishes were not dishes any more. i fed that bag blow after blow, reducing the evil contents from their form and function.

i found serenity then.

650,"(told in my dads perspective)

as i was working at the local machine shop this morning, i noticed that one of the machines wasn't working right. 
my boss, who was a self centered dick, was certain that there was nothing wrong with it. but i went to check it out anyway

sure enough, i was able to diagnose the problem, and as soon as i was able to prove to scd that the machine was really broken, he fired me.

yep. not a good day.

no",just read it.
651,"tifu man...so i recently got knee surgery and after the surgery, the doctor informed me that i would experience constipation, pain, etc.; the standard stuff. so about four days into recovery, nature calls, and i hobble into the bathroom. i plop down, preparing myself physically and mentally for sweet relief, and start. about ten seconds in, i realize that i'm turtle-heading. fuck me. so, i reverse the process and go about my business. 
the next day, things are going well besides the slight discomfort in my tummy, so i tell my mom i'm going to the bathroom. ""don't push too hard! you'll get hemorrhoids!"" bitch, please. i am expert as far as biblical shits go. so i sit down and engage in another encounter bout with the turtle-head. fecal matter-2 me-0. 
at this point i am at day 6 with no successful bowel movement, and i'm feeling kinda shitty. i'm chilling at a friends house, crushing water, eating healthy, doing anything to soften up this load, all the while complaining that i have to poop, as mental preparation of course. ""just go, dude!"" nah man. its not time. as i leave his house, i realize, its on. shits going down. i stumble into my house, and tell everyone present what's about to happen. no one cares. so i go into the bathroom and push like no other, conquering the monstrosity of a log and dropping it into the bowl. fuck yeah!. i go to bed that night, a little butthurt, but with a smile on my face, knowing i've conquered the beast.
this morning i wake up sore and feeling like i could empty a little more. it's just a little shit, but as it came out, it burned like the satanic fires of the circles of hell as i let out a gutt-wrenching scream. i stumble out of the bathroom and sit ever so delicately on the sofa, realizing that every movement hurts like a bitch. i pushed too hard, and am sitting on the softest things i could find as i type this. mom, your were right. poop, i concede to you, i fucked up.",mom told me not to push too hard. i did. hemorrhoids. poop wins.
652,"**see photos below**

first off, let me say to never try this unless you do your research thoroughly. i thought i had, but obviously not:

so this happened over the weekend, and my partner told me to share it. 

i had to go to a political science convention in a major city in texas, and i had been struggling with my weight because of some new medication i had been prescribed for my depression. unsatisfied with my size, and not being able to fit into my suit jacket properly, i turned to the internet for tips to lose a few inches for a day. i came upon an article that explained how models use duct tape to lose a few inches around their waist for photo shoots. i told myself that i could handle that for a day, a day in the heat of texas, and feel confident about my appearance in front of texas representatives and a senator. here's how my day went:

4am- took a shower and wrapped my waist in duct tape. i was feeling generous so i used a whole roll of duct tape.  

5am: forced to use absolute proper posture, i gallantly floated to my car and held my breath to sit and drive to campus.
 
6am: carpooled with my political science advisor and another student. sat in the back with perfect posture and short breaths for a 4 hour drive.

930am: convention starts and i am feeling great, and i am complimented on my appearance by some the students.

10am: first speaking panel begins. at this point, i can feel my chest tighten, and the room gets hotter, but no biggie.

1100pm: first panel ends, and i have to go to the bathroom. it was quite the challenge. i had the most perfect posture for any shitting session in existence.

1130pm: lunch begins and i am sitting with other students from other universities across the state. i start seeing stars, but control my breathing. everything is still okay.

1230pm: second panel starts with the senator speaking. at this point, there is a layer of sweat wanting to escape from underneath my duct tape girdle, but cannot due to the concrete stay of the tape. i adjust my sitting position and feel a sharp pain in my side; my skin tore. i started panicking, but kept my breathing in check and bit my cheek to help keep the pain at bay.

130pm: senator's panel ends, and i go for a meet and greet. at this point i am sure i look like i had a stick up my ass, but i push through wanting to meet the senator. after the meet and greet, i decide to go to the bathroom again. as soon as i sit down on the toilet, i can hear my skin, combined with the noise of the duct tape, tear. it hurt like a little bitch.

230pm: third panel starts. i am sitting next to the guy that came with me, and i start to see stars again. no ounce of effort puts my dizziness and light-headedness at bay, so i struggle to a standing position, tell my partner i'm not feeling well, and head back to the bathroom. 

245-315pm: i completely undress myself in the stall, choosing to rip off the duct tape as a last resort. i didn't want to have to bear the excruciating pain of duct tape being removed from my waist, especially my happy trail hair. i use this time to air out my whole body, and try and relax. but to my dismay, the pain of blistering and the uncomfortableness of not being able to breath properly, i decided it was time to remove it. 

315-430pm: i slowly wedge my fingers through the girdle, biting my tie to take the pain. it smelled horrible and was drenched in sweat. i find the end of the duct tape and start pulling off. it was easy unwrapping the layered bits, but when i got to the tape on skin part, i was so much in pain, i almost passed out. it took me a good 45 mins to remove most of it, but it got so unbearable, i sat on the toilet seat for a breather. at this point most of my skin was exposed, so breathing was back to normal. my mistake in taking a break was exemplified when i didn't realize i had some duct tape hanging low enough to be in view. some guy walked in, saw it, and freaked out. hoping i wouldn't get shot for appearing to use duct tape to strap myself with weaponry, i hastily removed the final bits of tape. this was my second mistake in the stall. i thought using my own spit would help ease it off, and i took a leap of faith by ripping it all off in one pull. *kshretk.* i successfully removed all the duct tape, but unfortunately ripped off a good 6 inches of skin. i swayed until i leaned up against the wall, trying my hardest to stay conscious. i don't think i had ever experienced such pain in my life before. i was bawling my eyes out, and biting my tie as hard as i could. after like 15 minutes, i took a deep breath and put my clothes back on, which was painful as fuck since my shirt rubbed against my exposed sub-dermal skin as well as numerous blisters through out my stomach. luckily, it turned out that the guy that walked in was the guy who came with us, thank god, and returned with my teacher. i embarrassingly explained to them what happened and they couldn't contain their laughter. 

430-8pm: the ride home was complete silence, with the occasional glance in the rear view mirror, followed by a cackle. 

 

**edit** [here are two photos so you can see the damage. it doesn't look so bad, but trust me, it hurts like a bitch.](http://imgur.com/yguabqk,r5uu66x) 

**edit2** yo guys, i am not stupid. i understand the healthy way to do this is to workout and eat right. that is what i have been doing. the reason for my stupid decision is i had ordered a suit jacket from amazon. it arrived late, the evening before the convention, and was the wrong size. there was nothing i could do. 

**edit3** yo guys, i am stupid.","duct tape really can be used for anything, even weight loss."
653,"i woke up this morning to an abundance of rain.  

oh well, the show must go on, so i do my hair and hope for the best.  my hair is an excess of frizz, fluff and curls.  a flat iron and products are my best friends.  

finish up the coffee and am ready to head out the door (still pouring buckets) when i realize my umbrella is in the car.  not a problem, i can fix this.  go back to the bathroom and get one of those little bathroom sized trash bags, and proceed to put it on top of my head.  hmm… there’s some hair still sticking out, so i pull it down further and poke out eye holes.  success!  ha!  fuck you mother nature – i win!

go down to the car and the family across the street is getting their kids in the car.  i wave, knowing i look like an idiot.  they just stare at me – they don’t even wave back.  they just keep staring at me – even as i get in the car.  i don’t think much of it.  at that point i’m not thinking much of anything because my coffee hasn’t kicked in and i’m wondering if i can remember how to operate my car.

anyway, i start driving to work and about halfway there i realize that i have indeed fucked up.  mostly because the trash bag on my head was white, had a point at the top and eyeholes poked out, and that the family across the street is black.","i wanted to keep my hair dry, and now my neighbors think i’m a member of the kkk."
654,"so, i have had this amazing african grey for the last 8 years. he has a vocabulary of over 150 words, and is capable of forming random sentences and shit.

anyway, here are a few fuckups following his ability to speak, and both my hobby of teaching him as well as my friend´s hobby of teaching him the most foul things.

1. we´re at a café. sesar (that´s his name) hates women and has always done. cute little waitress walks to our table, brings me a coffee and sesar a bowl of fruits (didn´t ask her for it even).
girl: awwww what a cute little guy^^ does he speak?
sesar: - shut up!
girl: wow, that´s some beak he got there?
sesar: fuck off! get out you twat! slut... (nb: not me who tought him the misogynistic thingies)
girl: ehh...right?
sesar: yeah, shove it! now fuck off...dog..*barks at her*

a few minutes later with the poor waitress bursting out in tears out of laughter, we were approached by the manager who said she had had some complaints from elderly people and people with young kids. we had to sit outside. sesar´s reaction? hysterical laughter all the way out. me? shamed and shamed and shamed for appearing to be a terrible owner, as he speaks in my exact voice...

2. sometimes when i teach him new stuff, he confuses the words. a few years ago, i wanted to teach him how to say ""help, i´ve been turned into a parrot!""... oh well, that didn´t go better than the fact that he only learned how to shout ""heeeeeelp!""
a few days later: sesar is practicing his new vocabulary in an extraordinarily manner. i mean really loud. i hear a knock on my door and something like ""this is the police! are you allright in there?"" is called from the other side of the door. 

i open the door with a large ""wtf"" on my face and they told me a concerned neighbour heard someone shouting for help from my apartment. then a loud ""heeeeeeelp!!"" is heard from the living room. cops rush there, see featherball on his stick laughing hysterically. cops went silent for a second, then joined sesar in hysterical laughter. parrot and cops became best friends and we ended up having a coffee and chatting about how this was one of their funniest incidents to date.

3. driving with sesar in the passenger seat on our way to get some burgers and go to my parent´s for a visit. had had a party the weekend before where apparently he was tought some very bad habits by my friends.

i order my food in the drive-thru, forget about the ball of feathers in the front seat and listen to music while i wait. all of a sudden i see that 4-5 staff members are gathered at the window, looking at sesar. sesar, silent until then, decides to put on public display his newly learnt vocabulary.... examples:

- *moans in a male voice, then moans as a female, then in the end moans a manly ""ahhhhhhhhhh"" *

- (in a female voice)*stop it! you´re being aggressive! (you´re being aggressive = sesar´s version of saying you´re nice... icelandic: þú ert ágætur(nice), sesar´s version: þú ert ágengur(aggressive) 
...*silence*...(male voice): come on! lemmeshag!...*moans manly*

- get... the... f****...out!....c***...dog...

- penispenispenispenispenis!!!....*hysterical laughter ensues*

needless to say, i got shamed by my own parrot.
this is not counting the times he has said other girl´s names if i´m having a girl over, cursing my grandparents, scolding my little nephew and teaching him bad words, biting my brother´s dog´s tail and nose etc etc etc

-sorry for no subtitles. only in icelandic


edit 2:

if you find this funny and want one, please don´t just because they speak. he´s extremely hilarious and has been the brightest point in my life for the last 8 years, but cags (as well as other parrots) are extremely demanding pets who deserve a lot of time caring for them, attention, training and such. i´ve never had a problem with him thankfully, but after i started working shifts full-time (i´m an emergency rn) he developed some problems. also, i had to move across the globe to do my master´s and it´s affecting him seriously. so please read a lot about those guys before you think about getting one. this is a huge commitment and a long term one, as these guys live normally for 40-60 years. more than happy to answer any questions in pm.


edit 3 (for the lulz)

more examples of his behavioral shenanigans (conditioned, i presume):

- always when someone opens up or drinks something for a can, sesar burps violently.

- if someone farts around him, sesar has been conditioned to say either ""good boy"" or laugh hysterically

- he also does the cutest things (non-vulgar ones): examples would be saying ""wannacuddle?"" and rub his beak on your fingers, ""gimmeakiss"" and rub his beak up to someone´s mouth (normally mine... during puberty he was a dick and did this and bit my lower lip in half)....

- he gets extremely horny after i take a shower. if i don´t take him into the shower with me, i´m rewarded with him trying to shag my hand when i get out of the shower",parrots are dicks.
655,"i was dreaming and in my dream, a cockroach was about to [fly at me](http://pestcemetery.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/flying-roach-pest-cemetery.jpg) 


i raised my hand in defence and covered myself in a blanket, the roach landed and was crawling around the blanket, i thought i felt it near my hand and bashed it away as hard as i could in four quick open hand slaps. full force. 


in real life, my hand was resting by my side, i apparently raised it, adjusted it right over my balls, and bashed them four times with machine gun speed. 


i woke up instantly, full of regret, and as i heard my alarm go off one minute or so later, i had to ask my wife to get up first to start the day and give me 'a minute.'

657,"i have working with a certain company down here in alabama who does electronic recycling, and they also sell products like computers, servers, switches, and a whole lot of other business equipment. they also have a small store which is set to close at the end of the year. they offer computer repair on the side, but it isn't very big and they only have someone work on computers 6 hours a week at most. i used to work at both locations, and i used to do full time computer repair for the store until they moved me to the main location, and put me in a customer service position for our ebay department. well, i love computer repair, and they completely removed me from being able to preform computer repair at work, so i posted an ad on craigslist to repair computers on my own time after work. my boss didn't like this, and terminated me on the spot because he says it competes with our store. no warning. no suspension. just straight up termination. i have worked with this company for about 2 years and 3 months with no write ups or really any disciplinary action, and the next day i am just completely terminated.",posted a computer repair ad because i love working on computers on my own time. boss saw it as competition and fired me after 2 years of employment.

and for this particular scene, i was driving. rather, i *have* been driving like a complete fuck-up. now, just to be clear, i haven't been into the automobile-driving business long- probably about 5 months into it.  

i've just recently learned that i had my high-beam switch perpetually forward, which means that every time, every instance i used my headlights, my high-beams would also turn on. so basically, morning and night. every bloody time i would go out during those hours. 

so for about...i would estimate, 2-months solid, i've been driving like a fuck-up. i'm sorry everyone i blinded. also, i actually didn't know that you're not supposed to leave your high-beams on, in the occasion someone passes you. so i *literally* blinded everyone i passed.

he fell for it! >:)

i kick him in the chest so he stumbles away, roll forward, pop to my feet and throw a punch.

i go down immediately, tap the ground with my good hand to show that i forfeit the match, and the members crowd around me. everyone knows what happened.

while the leader applies healing pressure points to my thumb, i am trying to get over the pain.

class starts.

fuck, i can't miss any more and neither can they.

before leaving the leader of the group goes to shake my hand.

he tricked me.

he grabbed my wrist, and thumb, and shoved it back into place.

it would have stayed that way if i hadn't flinched... you know, because of the **immense amount of pain.**

the thumb was relocated wrong and dislocated itself on my way to class.

i wound up just walking out of class and heading home to treat my poor poor thumb.

---------------------","i was in a fight with another member of my group, cause we were bored, and i dislocated my thumb. the leader accidentally relocated it in the wrong place, and it was dislocated again shortly after."
660,"yesterday afternoon, my mom told me that she needed my laptop tomorrow (today) morning to work because hers was broken. later that night, i was watching porn. i usually open a lot of tabs of porn videos, and do other things while they buffer so i don't have to wait while i'm at it. so i finish up and close my laptop. so the next day (today), i wake up to my mom's thunderous roar. she was pissed off and yelling about how embarrassed she was and shit, so i demanded an explanation. she told she went to our urbanization's clubhouse with my laptop because our internet signal fucked up. she wanted use the clubhouse's internet wireless signal, but she couldn't join the network (because she sucks with technology), so she asked a group of strangers to help her out. so these people come and check my laptop and my mom notices these shit-load of tabs, and she clicks them. so there they are watching daddy's little girl taking a bbc, and faye reagan on all fours, and other jizz-filled and screaming orgasm high quality shit. so my mom tells them: ""sorry, that's my son's,"" and they laugh at her. these people probably thought she was some fucked-up porn addicted public masturbator or some shit like that. i thought it was hilarious and she was pretty mad, but i could feel in her voice that she thought it was pretty funny, as well. she left my room, and although i was thinking how bad i fucked because my mom found my porn, i was thinking that there couldn't have been a better way for my mom to find my porn. better than catching me with my pants down and fapping in my room; outside, in front of random strangers, making her look like its hers, and me, far away. it was a pretty good unplanned prank, so i guess it's two-fold. it's a fuck up, but it isn't.

 

edit: i forgot to close the tabs, i don't leave open porn tabs open.

edit: some people are mad at me, but hey, chill. this is what tifu is all about. i know i fucked up.",- left porn tabs opened. mom opened them in front of random strangers.
661,"my girlfriend is 23, good looking, smart girl who loves sex. my exwife is an unnattracive 27y/o with an evil attitude and a vicious relationship history. 

this morning before i went to work, i had great sex with my girlfriend. we usually have good sex, but it really was a nibbling, groping, sloppy good time. it took a little longer for it to finish, so when we got done i ran off to work.

2 hours in, not enough work/too many employees and i get sent home. i text my ex wife to see if i can see my son today since i am not working anymore. she tells me that he is with her parents in (local big american city) but that she is near my place anyway, and she would come by (this is not unusual, we are trying to be friends as best as we can. her boyfriend and my girlfriend have always been understanding that we just want to be good parents).

so she comes by and i put down the video games so we can talk. we chit chat about things for a little bit when she notices the toilet paper next to the couch. if it was anyone else, they may have passed it off as toilet paper for a runny nose. but since i had been married to this woman, she knew it was for.. well, beating it.

my ex and my gf have gotten along since they met, even if they weren't friends. but, knowing my ex, she has always been very jealous of my gfs looks. she immediately begins to give me a hard time about not getting enough, asking why i was jerking off if she was taking care of me? i tried to remind her that i jerked off when we were together but she didn't seem to care. she just kept pushing the issue about not getting enough sex. (it is probably important to know that the only thing that never went bad between the ex and i was the sex).

i am not the most honorable man. yes, my gf is awesome. but when i am horny and being taunted, i go on the offensive. i began to make up stories about how long it has been since my gf and i had sex. i basically led her to believe that i was sex starved.

it didn't take much, given our history. we quickly began to remove our clothes when i remembered that i had sex that morning and had not yet had a shower. so as quickly as i could, i jumped on my ex, spread her legs and started pounding before she had a chance to even put her hand on my dick. we fucked all over the livingroom. we broke one of the legs of the couch. she got massive rugburn on her back. just an all out fuck fest for about 40 minutes.knowing she had meet her parents soon, and knowing how much i love to cum in her mouth, she gets on her knees and thirty seconds later i cum with a happy groan and lay down on the couch. 

she starts getting her shit together, but basically just slides on her pants and sweater, shoves everything else in her purse and lets herself out. i close my eyes, and pass out with a very satisfied smile on my face.

about 3-4 hours later, i get woken by a warm and soft wet tongue sliding over my dick. i wake up and realise that my gf is home and giving me head. although i would normally prefer it, i was super paranoid that she would smell my ex on me. so as smoothly as i can, i get her to climb up on top of me as i lay on the couch. she rides me for a while, then i stand up and have her kneel on the couch facing away from me so i could watch her ass bounce while i hit it from the back.. only..

asi slide inside her, she reaches down by her knee, in between the couch cusions. i'm starting to getmy rhythm, getting ready for full jackhammer mode when i see her hand pull up my ex's panties.

fuck.

i froze. like i couldn't move and i'm sure my body temperature instantly sank 10º. it is only for a moment, i try to recover, i want to give myself as much opportunity for excuses as possible-but, of course- she flips.

she pushes me off her and starts yelling and screaming. i can't tell her they are hers. i can't tell her they are a gift (sizes are noticably different). i try telling her it is a joke but that throws fuel on the fire. she breaks shit. she hits me. she totally (and justifiably) flips. the one and only tool i have is that there are no witnesses to 100% convict me. i use the argument: we had sex this morning and i'm hard now, how can you think i'm cheating on you? it fails miserably.

eventually, it starts to level out. i just might convince her that this was just a misunderstanding. i even offer her my phone to check to see that there was nothing to it, that i am an honest and reliable man who would never ever ever cheat on her. she takes my phone from me and i decide that going to the bathroom would look 'casual' and show her how confident i am that i am not doing anything wrong. 

mid-piss, i hear my phone get a text message. a few seconds later, i hear a huge crash in the kitchen and some kind of pop in the livingroom. i hurry my piss and run out in time for the door to slam as she ran out of the house. i jumped the smashed tv hurdle and glanced at the bar where all of my liquor bottles were shattered as i went outside. i tried to catch up but my gf drove away fast.

i was like 'wtf'? and i walked back in my house. as i surveyed the damage, i saw my phone amidst the shattered bottles of jack and i pick it up to call her.

that's when i see the message, from my exwife: shit i think i forgot my panties? you might want to find them before《your girlfriend》does.

so i thought that was it. it could not possibly get any worse, right? 

as i finish cleaning up the kitchen, i get a phone call. turns out- it's my ex's boyfriend. and he wants to kick my ass. apparently, my gf (ex gf at this point) drove to her house and confronted her. they did the whole ""bitch-cunt-i-hate-you thing"" when somehow he got involved. i said:

fuck.

i had no idea what to do. i lit a joint and sat down in my backyard and cried. then, i got a call from my ex wife, yelling at me because i lied to her when i said my gf and i didn't have much sex, and thatshe knew i had fucked my gf this morning.

so now.. i lost my gf. i am pretty sure i can't be friends with my exwife anymore. apparently i am notallowed to see my son anymore (i know she can't do that, but it is still going to be a massive headache), my house is torn to shit, and supposedly i am going to be attacked by my ex's boyfriends hillbilly thug friends (one of which i work with).","i had sex with my gf, then my exwife, then my gf, then got caught. now my house is in shambled and i lost all of them. and i hate hillbillies."
662,"so. this is my first post, but i feel that my fuck up should be announced to the internet. i love skiing, and on the day of my fuck up, i was somewhat hungry after a day at the terrain park. anyway, after getting changed, i'm feeling slightly peckish, and i make my way to a cafe that was near the resort where i was skiing. i don't have much money, but i have just enough for either a small tea, or, you guessed it, a cookie. i don't feel like a cup of earl gray, so i say fuck it, i'll take the cookie. as  i began eating it, i noticed it had rock hard bits in it, and the bits tasted like shit. my idiot conscience made the choice to finish the cookie, and wash it down with melted snow(don't judge me, i was thirsty). fast forward to midnight, when i wake up with the most ungodly of feelings in my stomach. fearing that the shitwater express will make its last stop in my pants and on the floor, i bolt to the bathroom. after reaching the toilet, my digestive system gives me a big fuck everything you love by sending at least 500 ml worth of vomit at high speed onto the floor, and coincidentally, my pants. fuck.","ate a cookie, nine hours later my stomach tricks me into thinking i will shit myself and i vomit on myself."
663,"i don't drink much; it's not really my thing. but when i do, i always drink *too* much, and i always eat a load of mcdonalds. this weekend past, i was going to a friends house party. because it was quite a nice day, my friends and i got started early on the pre-drinks. by the time we had left for our other friends, i had already had roughly half a bottle of bourbon and several weak pre-mixes a friend had brought. anyway, after the long and taxing train ride, we ended up at a mcdonalds just a few blocks from the intended destination. my (and a few of the other people i was with) significant others met us here as well, and we all had a small bite to eat.

however, i didn't have just a small amount of mcdonalds. having not eaten all day and being quite intoxicated, i ended up leaving 20 nuggets and 3 large servings of chips heavier. anyway, we end up at the intended house, a real swanky joint about 3 stories. we continue to drink, i polish of the other half of my bottle and several mystery shots. the night progresses, and as it does, i begin to regret my previous decision to eat more than my body mass in nuggets and chips (sarcasm) .

i end up (at roughly 2am) staggering to the toilet, but before i can make it, retching up almost all of my partially digested chips into the sink next to the toilet. hearing my graceful noises my girlfriend (training to be a nurse) rushes in to see if i need any help. seeing the mess, she assumes it will simply go down the sink. now this is were 2 things happen; i need to vomit again, and we find out that the sink is stuck on hot. just for reference, the weather during the day was 35 degrees or more (i'm from melbourne so that's pretty hot) and hadn't cooled down at all. anyway, the sink blasts into action, and by the time we realise the faucets design flaw, the sink has turned into a terrible hot mess of vomit and half digested chips. the emerging smell from the concoction prompts me to vomit again, this time luckily into the toilet. after retching for a while, my girlfriend tried (without luck) to both turn the tap onto cold, and to get the chips to fit into the stupidly designed plug. the heat from the day before coupled with the steam rising from the sink in the small confines of the bathroom spread the smell of the vomit, and does not do wonders for my worsening control over my stomach. eventually, my girlfriend comes to the conclusion that it just isn't going to work; so between my nugget-filled vomiting into the toilet, she scoops the vomitty goodness out, a chunky handful at a time, and pours it into the toilet.

664,"i got high. made pizza pockets 30 minutes later. i put them down on my chair to grab my xbox headset and controller and sat down on the pizza pockets. i heard a splootch sound and my ass got hot all of a sudden. luckly there was minimal pizza leakages on to my pants. pictures of the devastation can be added if needed/requested.

665,"so, every day when i come home from work or school (i'm sixteen) i use the restroom. i always reddit while on the toilet because the only thing that would make that situation is better is food.

anyways, so i leave the restroom after about half an hour and go for my room, but my mother follows me. 

she tells me she needs to talk to me so we go in the living room. she then proceeds to tell me masturbating is unhealthy, especially so much. she tells me the fact that i don't even try to hide it anymore is disgraceful. when i ask her about hiding it, she looks at me like i'm stupid and asks me what i think everyone thinks i do for long periods of time in the bathroom. 

i begin to tell her i'm not pulling my pork, i'm reddit. she then tells me she doesn't want the details and my sexual activities need to be limited.","i whack off with my family awake and in the other room, and reddit is porn.**"
666,"so i've been sick with the flu for the past two days. long story short, i had a coughing fit and lost control of my anus. luckily, my underwear absorbed most of it and i was able to clean up ok and just toss them out. no one would have even known if i wasn't a redditor who now automatically assumes shitting yourself is completely normal. so, when my non-redditor wife returned home to check on me and ask me how i was doing, i told her all about it. she has not quit giving me shit about it since. every time i cough i hear ""careful you might shit yourself!"" or ""do you need to check your pants?"" if enough time goes by without me coughing, she starts talking to our 4 month old son about how daddy poops himself, too. and if i tell her it's getting old, she brings up my most embarrassing childhood moment when i shit myself in kindergarten (a story that was shared in confidence) and says something along the lines of just being happy i'm not at work to recreate that moment. on the one hand, i'm happy to know that even though my wife's not a redditor, she still has the sense of humor as one. on the other, the relentless barrage of jokes is getting insanely old. if you are ever in my shoes, just do a reddit post and never tell a soul who actually knows you.","- shit myself, told my wife, have been mocked relentlessly ever since."
667,"during the breaking bad episode last night i got a notification about one of my tweets on #breakingbad. the reply to my tweet said that i won a copy of the boxed edition breaking bad dvd set. i went to the site, redeemed my code, and gave the scammer my address, email, and phone number.",i am an idiot.
668,"this was saturday night actually, but the true severity of the fuckup wasn't apparent until this morning.

so i play bass in a punk/metal band. one thing i like doing to ward off any stage jitters is semi-regular karaoke. if i'm not performing with the band at least perform. really does make it easier to get in front of people when you do it frequently.

anyway, i'm really drunk -  some school was having their 30 year reunion there that night and this table full of women (and a couple of their husbands) kept pouring shots of crown down my throat. i'm not one to say no to free whiskey.

so i get called up for my song, and i don't hear the opening drum hits and miss the start :( completely threw me off, but i recovered after a measure. this is why you don't play drunk.

at the end of the song i walk over to hand the mic back to the kj, and don't realize that the stage ends before her table. i fall as suddenly there's no stage, land flat on the table and send her drink flying, spill it all over the place. i got up, went and grabbed a towel from the bar to clean up, apologized profusely. 

i must have landed badly on my leg because my knee is completely fucked. i was too drunk to notice saturday. yesterday it hurt and i knew why, but today it's just agonizing and stiff. i could barely get into my car to go to work this morning.","tried a chris cornell impression, wound up doing a chris farley impersonation instead."
669,"so this was a while ago. whatevs. still pretty fucked. 

so in high school, i played rugby (check my post history for a little surprise there). like most school teams do, we had a rookie party after the season was over. the details of the party are unimportant, the only thing that matters is that i was 10/10 blackout. straight assed. 

the next morning, my body turned on me. 

first was the shit. 

the shit. 

i sat on the toilet and tried to avoid passing out from the smell emanating from the bowl below me. it was awful. it felt like i was puking out of my asshole. i wept. i prayed. it made me the man i am today. 

after that asscapade i knew wiping was out of the question, so i turned on the shower and spread em. a brown stream ran towards the drain as i let the warm water have it's way with me. all this time i thought, okay, this day might not be ruined yet. i might be clean. 

then i popped a boner. 

maybe it was the water on my bung hole. maybe it was just morning wood. but whatever the reason, i thought to myself, *hey, you know what would make you feel better? a quality jerk sesh.*

so jerk it i did. as i trucked along, i felt as though my headache was going away. this feeling was marvellous. i was healed. 

then i came. 

as i finished my previous euphoria evaporated into nausea and shame, and my stomach began to turn. i puked and puked until i couldn't puke anymore. it splashed on my legs. it was horrific. i thought this was the worst morning of my life. *this has got to be the most awful thing i could imagine*. that was before i fell. 

my assorted bodily fluids had lubricated the floor, and my retching had done just enough to throw me off balance. i felt like that statue of saddam. this time i did cry a bit. i only missed the tap by a couple inches, no doubt saving me a wicked conkie. i still shudder to think of my parents walking in on that scene.","i got in the shower clean and ended up covered in cum, puke, and shit."
670,"##background
i've had some pretty bad sinus issues for going on a month now. between my inability to breath and severe sinus migraines, it's been hell. i've been on some supposedly high-quality anti-biotics as well as pain medication from the gods themselves. i've also spent some time away from my house, hoping it was allergies (dogs + dust galore at home) or maybe some fungus in the house. unfortunately, i'm still the same as i was when it started, but now i'm at my grandma's for a week. one of my aunts and her family are also living here because of financial troubles and because my grandparents are getting old.

our bathroom layout is kinda important to the story as well. it looks kinda like this:

    .     ______
    .   w|d s t|
    .    |l b b|
    .    -------
where w is the window, d is the door, s is the sink t is the toilet l is the linen closet (towels/medicine/other junk) b is the bath. the back of the sink and toilet are on the same wall as the door, the top wall, and the drain and shower head are on the right wall. the linen closet upens towards the door. oh, and there's a garbage can between the sink and toilet.

##today
i was feeling really out of it this morning, worse than before actually. i felt like i had pneumonia, and did cough up a bit of liquid. i'm assuming it was mucus but who really knows. regardless, i woke up late this morning, had some breakfast and went to lay back down for a bit. after a little bit of screwing around on the computer, i fell asleep again. when i woke up, i had to pee.

##i fucked up
i walked out of my bedroom and straight to the bathroom. the door was open and light was on, but that's normal for this house. first thing i did when walking in the door was start coughing and trying to clear some shit from my throat. standing front of the sink i bet over spit some chunks into the garbage can. with my head still pretty much over the closed toilet, i did a full breath snort to try and get more cleared.

##instant regret.

i could smell, tasted, and feel pure diarrea throughout my body. i assume someone clogged the toilet and left it. i started throwing up immediately, spewing all over the toilet. i knew that the toilet was the problem, so opening it up and puking into it would have only made it worse, and the trash was full, so i pulled back the curtain and puked into the bathtub.i couldn't stop myself puking long enough to leave the bathroom. every time i got close to stopping, i couldn't catch my breath without smelling more shit and puking again.

after about two minutes of this, i had lost enough breath that i was close to passing out so i tried to force myself to get out the door. unfortunately, i really, really, fucked up and slipped backwards into the corner of the sink which then resulted in me puking all over the open linen closet. i couldn't keep myself stand after that, and fell sideways through the open door right at my aunt's feet. i was wheezing, coughing, and dribbling vomit literally on her shoes.

rather than helping me, she started screaming at me. ""what the fuck nedryos? you ruined the bathroom!"" at that point, if i had any energy left in me, i would have killed her. finally out of the stink, i was able to sorta catch my breath again and after another minute or two i was able to stand and move myself into the kitchen. i just sat there for a few minutes looking like i had been pepper sprayed: eyes watering, face all blotchy, breathing hard, and trying not to vomit.

my aunt said some more shit to me that i don't remember but was probably exceedingly retarded. rather than dealing with them right then, i changed my clothes, cleaned myself up and left. i'm sure i'm going to catch some shit, but i just can't deal with them.

so. tifu.",snorted liquid shit and puked all over the bathroom.
671,"i am a student in a very religious school, i am not religious myself but i'll skip straight to the point.

it was our last period and our teacher allowed us to play a game,

it just had to be charades...

so it came to my turn but i refused and they just kept taunting me and telling me i should be a man and do it, it went to the point that i just stood up, picked up my friend and threw him face first into the wall.

i then proceeded to rant how i don't want to play and just started yelling and telling them to shut up but they wouldn't.

so it came to the point where i had to yell at the top of my lungs for them to shut up, the entire freaking building heard it.

fast forward 3 hours later i get pulled into the guidance councilor's office and given a lecture that i shouldn't have yelled at them and people have worse lives than me, yeah like that's supposed to help?

the very next day as i walk in the door (what i am about to tell you is 100% true.)almost everybody panics and just runs out the other door onto the cat walk leaving me alone in the room with just me, the class president and my best friend.

they both explain that after my outbreak yesterday everybody is scared of me, even the people from other classes.","lost my shit, now most feared person in my entire grade."
672,"ok, i have to say first that this actually happened about 3 weeks ago, but in my defense i just discovered this subreddit existed today.

a few months ago i received an old japanese arisaka rifle from my grandfather after he passed. i have spent the last few months researching the gun to figure out it's type and year of production when i came across a factoid that said that the gun weighs 9 lbs. i always thought the gun was heavy, but i never would have guessed almost 10 lbs. heavy.

i decided i would compare its weight with some of mine and my dad's old hunting guns because i really didn't have anything better to do for a few hours. i went into my dad's room, opened the gun cabinet, and started going through the guns one by one, shouldering them for a few seconds, and then putting them back. after about 5 rifles, i got to the shotguns. i picked up my dad's 20-gauge shotgun, shouldered it, and-

bam!

after a few seconds of shock at what just happened, i saw pictures and papers flying around the trajectory of the shot. after i realized that the gun had just fired, i quickly started going over the weapon to figure out what had just happened. turns out the gun had 3 shells of bird shot in it and the safety was off. when i was shouldering the gun, my finger must have moved ~~out of instinct and squeezed the trigger~~, but the whole moment is a blur to me, even now.

**edit: seeing how i apparently got fuotw, i want to make something clear for future readers: i do not instinctively put my finger on the trigger every time i handle a firearm. i make a clear effort every other time to keep it either extended or rested below the trigger guard when handling my gun when i'm not firing it. it was this one time when, through a combination of other factors (thinking my dad would never keep a loaded gun in his cabinet, knowing i would only be handling the gun for a few seconds to gauge their weight only, etc.), i made the dumbass mental decision to forgo the rules this one time, and it cost me. when i was gauging the shotgun, i never made the mental effort to control where my finger went, so it went to where my mind said the most comfortable position on a firearm would be: the trigger. it wasn't really instinct, more a lapse in discipline at the worst possible time. a few people in the comments took my poorly worded explanation to mean that i always handle a gun in this manner, but i can assure you this was and will always be a one time mistake i will not be repeating.**

now, i'm an experienced hunter, and i know how to handle a firearm. i grew up taking the rules of gun safety very seriously when out in the field or with guns i never personally handled. rule one of firearm safety is always assume the gun is loaded. however, this situation had caused me to lax the rules just slightly because a.) i wasn't planning on loading or messing with these weapons beyond a few seconds out of the cabinet each and b.) my father is one of those guys who made sure i never forgot the rules of gun safety. he always warned me about being stupid with firearms and to never forget to unload a weapon when it was not being used, so i didn't assume the shotgun would have anything in the chamber. i still made sure i wasn't aiming the gun in the direction of any homes or irreplacable items. that rule is more muscle memory than anything to me at this point. i won't even point toy airsoft guns at people unless we're using them for their intended purpose.

anyway, i quickly cleaned up the mess and surveyed the damage. because my mind worked enough to make sure that i at least didn't shoot anything valuable, the damage was pretty minimal, at least as far as shooting a shotgun in the house went. i had blown a hole clean through my dad's pillow and a box of lightbulbs, knicked his alarm clock, and blew a dent into the wood siding on his wall. i went into crazy-fast ""fix everything quick before anyone finds out"" mode and managed to actually replace the siding on the wall in less than an hour (we have a bunch of leftover planks from when we did it a few years ago). luckily the shot wasn't powerful enough to go through the wood, so no further damage apart from the siding. i still ended up telling my dad the next day what had happened, and instead of beating me to death with a rusty chain like i was sure he was going to do, he just sat there in silence for few minutes before telling me to just go while he checked the rest of the guns. turned out he had left the gun loaded when he, get this, was using it to scare off some people who had started sneaking into our yard a week after our house was broken into. we're deep in the sticks, miles from town, so that stereotypical appalachian mindset starts to set in when your property is being threatened with him. he'd load the gun with a shot or two, go outside, and shoot it into the ground to scare them off. the last time he had done this, about 2 months earlier, he forgot to take the shells out of the gun and to turn the safety off.

so what did i learn from my little idiot moment? never forget the rules of gun safety, no matter how safe you think the situation is. i was just lucky no one was home when i did this. also, my dad is apparently where i get it from.

 

took some pictures of the damage to remember my stupidity.

673,"so i wasn't feeling well this morning and decided not to eat anything before going to a job interview at 2 pm. i've been unemployed for nearly three months now, so i was really freaking out that i needed the job very badly. as i was sitting in the lobby, which was pretty warm mind you, i started getting very dizzy and felt like i was going to vomit. instead of waiting to throw up in the lobby, i wandered down the hall and found a kitchen but i couldn't find a garbage can. as i wandered in delirium i found my way into a copy room where i promptly fainted and face planted on a copy machine.


i don't know how long i was out for but i woke to a guy asking if i was ok and did this happen often? i kept maintaining that no, i was fine, until i touched my face and noticed my cheek and forehead were bleeding profusely. the receptionist came to check on me, and soon afterward the paramedics took me to the hospital to get patched up.


i don't think i'm going to get that job.","before my job interview could start, i fainted, hit my head, and had to be taken to the hospital."
674,"this weekend i went to a crawfish boil/bbq where there was a large bonfire. spent the evening  partying with strangers and friends, drinking quite heavily as one might do at such an event. later in the evening the fire began to die down, so i began to pile on my wood. soon i was deemed fire marshall pleasekillyourcat, and my drunk pyro ass really got into it. got the fire raging pretty good. eventually i was completely hammered and i began to fall down into the pile of wood to be burned as i gathered it, leaving me with a few very minor scrapes on my arms and stomach. fast forward to monday when i begin to notice that some of the scrapes are becoming itchy and inflamed. i also begin to notice what i believe to be red bug/chigger bites on my genitals. fast forward yet again to today (thursday), when i finally realize that i somehow came into contact with poison ivy and have evidently scratched it, spreading it onto several areas of my body, including pretty much my entire genital region. now as a child i occasionally got into poison ivy and a good scrubbing with clorox always killed it pretty quickly. did a quick google to make sure clorox was an appropriate treatment for poison ivy and proceeded to hop in the shower. i then scrubbed all the affected areas. my arms, stomach, and legs stung a bit, but i toughed it out. the immediate application of bleach to my gonads was not so bad, so i went ahead with the full on power scrubbing method which i used on the rest of my body. i honestly think that if i had literally torched my genitals they would have burned less. i screamed like a banshee rape victim for a good solid 5 minutes. i am now on the couch naked with a cold rag on my fire engine red testicles, nauseous from the pain, hoping beyond hope that this will subside soon. i most definitely fucked up this time, folks.",clorox is a great treatment for poison ivy anywhere except your gennies.
675,"alright, here's one for you techies out there.

i was working on a project, and i had just gotten access to the git repository (so no files were yet committed) so, i did a git add *before* adding a .gitignore for the project. by doing so, i had checked in the wrong files.

but i thought, no big deal, ill just add a git ignore, unstage the changes, and re-stage them, right?

so i added the gitignore, and here's where i made the mistake. instead of using ""git reset *"", i used ""git rm -r *"". 

i didnt realize that git deleted the actual files on disk, and so i lost my past month of work.","a tool meant for backing up files caused me to delete them. fuck you, git."
676,"i study in an european country, and had just gotten back from summer vacation. so my friends got together to catch up and during the night we got really high. the following munchies resulted in a personal best at the local takeaway shop. 

after a long and hard feast we had finally eaten up everything, the only piece of food left, was this crust from my pizza. my friend who is a living waste disposal unit offered to take care of the last pice, but greedy as i am i throw myself over the table to protect whats mine. i engulfed it like a hungry child from the african wilderness which haven't eaten in weeks, and was more inhaling it rather than eating it. a second later my world stops. 

it felt like i couldn't breath, but high as i was i wasn't able to determine whether or not i had in my bronchus or if it just had gotten stuck in my pharynx. i didn't want make a fool of my self so i spent like 10 seconds to analyze the situation an concluded with that the crust actually had found its way to my lung, and after that i just panicked. 

i started running around in the apartment and trying to explain the other guys what happened, and when they finally understood what was going on i was starting to become blue in my face and on my hands. at this point i was about 99% certain that i was going to die, high as hell and with a pizza pice in my lung. it was a really emotional moment for me, i  started to imaging what my mother was going to think when she heard her only son have died of a pizza and stuff like that.

finally my friends had came to their senses to rescue me and started to do all kinds of stupid stuff to get it out. nothing worked and finally they decided to call an ambulance. i was pretty sure i wasn't going to make until it showed up so i actually started to resign and accept the fact that i was going to die on the floor. this was kind of a relief and i started to relax, and suddenly i started to breath and was able to feel what was going on.

turns out i hadn't got the pice of crust in my lung, it only had got stuck in my pharynx after all, i had panicked so hard that i had forgotten to breath and during the following stress i had tightening my chest up so it only felt like i wasn't able to breath.

in the middle of my friends conversation with the emergency central i stood up and called them of. 30 seconds later everything was fine and back to normal. 

i have been bullied a half year now for this episode and every time i eat when i´m high after this i get flashbacks. 

so i´m guessing the moral in this story is don't  do drugs and don't get greedy.","was high, got munch, eat a shitload of food, chocked on pizza, though i was gonna die, ambulance was called, turns out i didn't chocked after all. pretty embarrassing."
677,"my old car had lock problems so i lock even my new(er) car out of habit as i get out. well i drove up to the kfc and i see an adorable little cat hanging out under a giant truck. i felt like taking pictures....

as i got out of my car i locked it behind me. the cat ran away, and i went in to eat. my pockets were light so i did the triple tap. it was no good... $50 dollars and 20 minutes late to get back to work and i the shop guys are offering me hammers :(","took cat pic, left my keys in my locked car, $50, mocked**"
678,my friend (girl) lives in student housing and one of the rules is no guys sleeping over and they have to be out by 11 pm. well since i used to live in the same complex the managers knew what my car looked like. so i left a little past curfew on a few occasions and slept over one night. she is now getting evicted.,i broke the rules and she is paying for it.
679,"so it's spring break, and i didn't go anywhere because i convinced myself i was gonna do work (yeah, right), and i decided the last couple days to work from home and not go into the lab. that means unlimited access to reddit and the rest of the internet. well yesterday i was reading an article on r/seddit about this guy who picks up women using sites like plentyoffish.com and shit like that, and i was bored, so i signed up there for free. i don't even know why, i have a few girls i could go out with an date, but like i said, i was bored. and then, there was an ad that said ""just want to hook up? try 'this site'!""....and like an idiot i clicked, made a profile there too, and then started getting responses from a few people. but, it turns out you can't even send a message back or read more than one message without subscribing. so, i looked at the rates and saw it was like $20 for one month, and i figured ""fuck it, less money than a night at the bar,"" and entered in my info and stuff. except i forgot to click the one month box and left it on one year instead. $100 for a hookup site i just wanted to use for amusement until i leave the city i'm in. and i'm not rich by any means, so that was a pretty big fuckup.","i was bored on the internet, signed up for a hookup site out of boredom, accidentally spent $100 instead of $20."
680,"i was out with a few friends and my girlfriend celebrating green beer day, an annual tradition at my school the thursday before spring break, and i had ate some pretty greasy fish sandwiches earlier for lunch. unknowingly this cheap green beer and fish sandwich cocktail was brewing in my stomach to create the worst gas on earth. i am talking like walk into a house with a dead body that has been there for a month bad. after these waves of gas hit me, i start to sweat and suggest to my gang of fellow celebrators that we go back to my girlfriends house so i can unleash this monstrosity within me. when we get there it is full of girls and i can't bring myself to release the kraken in their presence. but i have such an intolerable pressure building inside me, i have to pass gas just one more time. i excused myself to another room that was empty and proceeded to let it rip, fully trusting my sphincters capability to hold back this blitzkrieg in my underpants. oh god was i wrong. i proceeded to empty my bowels with the worst smelling, greasiest shit pile i have ever experienced. i immediately felt the shame. luckily i was wearing boxer briefs so it was all contained. afterwards i went to the bathroom, scooped the shit into the toilet, rinsed my underwear in the sink, then not knowing what to do with them after that, i threw them in the packed cupboard  under the sink. i plan to pick them up at some point later today, but man am i hoping one of the 10 girls that lives with my girlfriend doesn't find it first.","ate fish sandwhich, drank green beer, tried to fart, shit myself, threw soiled underwear under my girlfriend's sink."
681,"so a couple weeks ago i pre order kavinsky's - outrun album on cd and have been eagerly awaiting for it to arrive, and a few days ago i bought a new stereo for my car with the main attraction being bluetooth calling/hands-free.

the horrible misadventures of thedoctorg20 and gatsby: part one

so everything was pretty normal today, just hanging out after attending my first class and waiting for my next to start at 4. as i sat there in my siberian husky boxers (every man should own a pair) and contemplated life while watching nicholas snooze the day away (he is an adorable sleeper, you're not the police of me) my phone vibrates and i peer over my shoulder to see who it was. [name withheld] had texted me! we had been talking for a couple of days and the night previous i had convinced her to send me some racy pictures so she obviously found it troublesome to contain the sexual beast that i had unleashed inside of her. she wanted to visit me and i could naught but oblige....

i'll take this moment to explain my genitalia. i named it gatsby for the purpose of this story because it likes to party and have fun but goes for the wrong woman and inevitably gets into a lot of trouble. it likes any and all attention and has the amazing ability to blind myself from obvious emotional and mental issues regarding the owner* of the vagina it so desperately seeks out. the old adage states: ""don't stick your dick in crazy."" however, it appears that my penis misinterpreted it to read, ""find every crazy girl you can and put me inside so i can get cozy and introduce myself to her crazy attachment gland and we can become bgf's (best glands forever)""

*see ""[previous crazy girl]"" 

back to our story. after a small conversation the time was determined and i began to contemplate my next move. i decided a shower was more than necessary so after cleansing my body of its natural oils i began to dress and prepare for her arrival. applying my cologne (smell like a god erryday) and putting on my typical hipster-esk clothing. 

she finally graces the floor with her presence. i am actually kind of glad to see her at first: sweet smile, nice eyes, etc. we talk with some guys on the floor as nick rolls out of bed and showers (1:00pm) to prepare for his day. we head back into my room and sit on my bed while i display my usefulness and my uncanny ability to find adorable pictures of baby seals (it's an art form). nick returns from his shower, we joke around and chat as he gets dressed and gathers his things. but wait, he doesn't have class until 2:30? why is he getting all of his stuff together if it is only 1:15? because he is a damn fine wing-man that's why. he eases his way out of the room and shuts the door. 

let the games begin....


the horrible misadventures of thedoctorg20 and gatsby: part two

finally alone, she makes no effort to control herself as she jumps my bones, hitting my head on the bed in the process. i combat her merciless advances and pry her off, stumbling towards the door. after locking the door (don't need any more jockeys for this rodeo) i walk back to the bed where she has already taken off her shirt and is beginning to unbutton her pants. i, being the gentlemen i am, slow her down as i am normally more one who enjoys the pregame as much as the super bowl. 

i think this is an appropriate time to mention a crucial detail or two that i may have neglected to share in the first installment.... this girl's legs are harder to close then the jonbenét ramsey case. she continuously complained to me about guys only wanting her for her body and ditching her as soon as she had sex with them, so naturally i told her that we shouldn't do anything too crazy sexual on our third time seeing each other. she agreed and seemed entirely fine with our mutual decision brought into question by her in the first place, that is until we were actually in the bedroom with nothing between us but her jeans, my sweet sweet corduroys, and the aforementioned husky boxers (once again, cannot stress how important these are). 

flash to the present and we see a passionate session of tender romance unfolding. she has a reasonable pair of supple breasts, not as big as i would like but nothing that would drive me away by any means. she also had semi-disproportionate nipples, but i wasn't about ready to complain and risk spoiling the moment. the first real sentence out of her mouth since this all started was something along the lines of ""let's get naked, but not totally naked because then we might accidentally have sex teehee."" 

whatever.

i strip her pants off as gracefully as i can (she does that little hip arch that all girls do when their clothes suddenly become toxic and they must be removed immediately for fear of contamination). so the scenario is this: i in my boxers, and her in her lacy panties and bra (she wore lacy panties, she knew shit was about to go down) lay together embraced in an affection make out session. this is about as far as i thought the day would go, maybe some hands in some places or something along that same vein. i pictured us getting hot and heavy then maybe a little finger bang here and a little head there, typical collegiate stuff after only recently meeting someone.

nope.

""fuck me."" i pulled back from her and stared into her eyes, albeit very confused. did she really just say that? what happened to our agreement? ""i thought we decided that we weren't going to do any of that stuff today? you said you were tired of guys leaving you after they sleep with you and that sounds oddly reminiscent of this situation right now."" she half scoffed half chuckled and nodded her head. i don't get it... is it now cool to do this even though we had just decided against it a mere forty-five minutes prior?! i played it off as if she didn't say it and just continued along the same path i was going until about a minute later the topic arises again.

this is where things get interesting…

the horrible misadventures of thedoctorg20 and gatsby: finale

after continually holding off her advances for sexual gratification for a solid 10 minutes, she gets even more desperate. commence compliments such as the following: ""but you're so big it would just feel amazing and be really fun.""(edit: i'm actually wonderfully average, she was being quite flattering) ""i want you inside of me, your fingers aren't doing it for me anymore."" (and my personal favorite) ""i'm starting to lose interest, you'd better fuck me cause i'm bored.""

at this point i'm annoyed. i just wanted some harmless make-out time with a handful of some ass and a mouthful of titty. is that too much to ask?! apparently not, apparently it wasn't enough to ask at all. 

after shutting her down for what appears to be the last time, i literally breathe a small sigh of relief. mistake. she seems to take this small action not as a sign that i'm glad the worst has passed, but instead as a relinquishment of my true desires and a sign of potential boredom. ""daddy likes it rough and freaky, eh?"" she pondered. ""i can manage that.""

she turns her head back bites me on the nipple. not a nibble, or even a tease. bitch goes straight up mike tyson v. holyfield on poor little lefty. ""what the hell?"" i gingerly pull her head back and look at her with what i thought portrayed a look of utter shock and befuddlement. wrong again self. the face i gave apparently said 'lick my face and then laugh and bite my shoulder to the point that a small trickle of blood emerges.' she obliged. 

now i am legitimately a little scared of this sexual demon. i push her back and scramble for something to say to get her away from my upper body to save myself from the horrors that were sure to unfold if this went unchecked. recalling that she 'really likes to give head', as she puts it, i blurt out ""maybe you should just suck my dick so all of this tension goes away?"" yes... let the girl that just bit your shoulder wrap her lips around gatsby... perfect. 

luckily she seemed pretty enthused by this and went down gladly. with the care of a baby seal wrapped in feathers and clouds she went to work. i desperately tried to think of anything that would make me finish quicker: holly peers (hothothothothot), past sexual encounters, anything. i could care less if i get labeled as a premature by this girl i just want this over. but suddenly, as if she could read my thoughts, she stops and says ""actually i shouldn't do this, it's just going to make me want to fuck you more.""

are you kidding me?! this was my way out. i was home free. i weakly murmur something along the lines of ""okay, that's fine"" and prepare to just cuddle the remaining thirty minutes of time away, tears welling up at the potential for the epic blue balls sure to befall me within the hour. then, the biting starts again. and the compliments. 

screw this, i'm gonna fuck this girl and pray to god she shuts up and stops bothering me. ""alright fine, let’s do this."" she spreads her legs open like a giddy schoolchild opening her lunch box to see what mommy packed for lunch today. luckily she was still as wet as can be so i slipped inside and started the ritual mating dance of my family. start out slowly, build momentum, and breathe at regular intervals. after the first 20 seconds or so she tells me to just fuck her hard and get it on. 

per her request, i pull out to the extent of my reach and lay into her. 

8 pumps. my tattoo (an 8 on my ankle, it’s a family thing) has never been more relevant than it was now. now i'm not saying that i finished in 8 pumps... no that would be too easy of an ending to this story. on the eighth stroke she bursts into tears and begs me to stop. wut. i wasn't even at full throttle and she taps? what gives? turns out that she wanted to have sex with me more than she worried it would affect our chances at dating, but on commencement of the act changed her mind immediately and started crying at the thought of what she had done. she profusely apologizes to me and claims it was all her fault for letting this happen. 

i hugged her out of sheer terror that she would begin wailing and cry rape or something crazy along those lines, and she finally calmed down. after a couple minutes she insisted on finishing me off so i wouldn't suffer blue balls, but i wasn't about to let anything near gatsby but her hands. after what seemed like an eternity i alerted her of my current orgasmic state at which she plonked gatsby into her mouth in anticipation of the coming tides. bad call. turns out i hadn't emptied the tank in a couple days (five to be precise) and the sexual build up and relaxation had only caused more production. it sounded like she had just swigged back a gatorade after running a 5k. whatever, no mess for me to clean.

seeing that it is about 3 o'clock, we both begin to dress and prepare to head to our respective classes (me a little faster than her) and i put on some drum & bass music to calm my nerves and distract me from the misery i endured. we walk till our paths split at which point i begrudgingly engage in a hug goodbye. she tries to kiss me on the lips in the crowded area. dodge. agility +5. she kisses me on the back cheek instead, seems pleased, and heads off to class. 

i hurried to class and began to pen this upon arrival, as i knew that this tale needed to be shared. this is the bane of my existence. gatsby gets me in more trouble than he is worth, but god dammit it gives me crazy ass stories to tell and as long as i don't get stabbed i chalk it up as a win in the end. i've loved writing this story for you gents, and have plans to have it published in the near future (i'll probably just copy all this into ms word). 

if this story has a moral, i can't find it. shit was weird, and i didn't learn a thing.

edit: due to questions about the following statement ""the ass was fat"", i would like to clarify that it was the saving grace in this tale and the only thing that kept me from passing into the realm of insanity.

edit #2: for those doubting a little bit of my story, here is a sample of our text conversation this morning; the calm before the storm http://i.imgur.com/ii9aypb.png

edit #3: wow, i am really enjoying reading all the critiques and feedback! may your gatsby (or for the ladies, daisy) serve you well.","i eight-pumped a horny co-ed to shut her up, she bursts into tears and then apologizes for it. the ass was fat."
683,"what you think happened didn't happen.

i am a teacher. i dropped some papers at work and started to bend to pick them up. at the same moment, a student comes barreling down the hall at top speed and his shoulder collides with my face.

my vision swims for a moment and when i come up i realize i'm laying flat on my back and there's a web of white in front of my left eye. it's my glasses-the lens got a bunch of cracks in. i sit up and what seems to be the entire student body is staring at me. my nose is bleeding. i get helped up.

'are you okay?' i'm asked. 

'i've had worse.' i pick up my papers and go to the nearest washroom to survey the damage.
glasses broken (ray ban's), teeth loose, bloody nose, and cheek swollen up like a bitch and eye a nice shade of purple under the spider-web lens. 

fifteen minutes later i'm sitting at my desk with ice on my face. such is life.",today i fucked up by bending over. today student fucked up by running into me with his big beefy quarterback shoulder. -.-
684,"so, we have a little pond in our garden with a few goldfishes. i was home alone and i went outside to check up on my rabbit and my chickens (to make sure everything was okay for the night). when i walked past the pond i saw one goldfish lying upside down at the surface. assuming he was dead i reached over and of course my brand new phone falls into the quite blurry water. needless to say i panicked and put my whole arm directly into the water. after about 3 min i managed to grab my phone, by that time my sleeve was soaking wet. and by my sleeve i mean my whatusedtobewhite-sleeve of my new and quite expensive shirt. now it is covered in goopy brown stuff that won't get off. my phone is almost peeing water at this moment and i suddenly remember a lifehack that i read this site once (the put your phone in rice-lifehack). so, running to the kitchen, grabbing the pack of rice out of the cabinet, somehow ripping the bottom open and spilling it all over the floor. i gathered some of the rice together and put it in a bowl with my phone. then i grabbed the vacuum and started vacuuming the rice things, right in front of our stove which had a kettle of boiling soup on it. somehow i managed to knock the kettle over and causing it to spill all over my leg that is now burned pretty hard. rushed upstairs to the shower so i could let some cold water stream over it, turned on the wrong tap and got a nice potion of steaming hot water over my already burned leg. so at this point i wouldn't mind if you would come to kill me.

 

edit: here are 2 pics (one of my phone swimming in a bowl of rice and one of the fish that was lying upside down) http://imgur.com/a/pmeyo","dropped my phone into the water, ruined my new phone and shirt, try to minimize the damage, spill rice all over the place and burn myself twice"
685,"the day started off nice and i had woken up ealry. i had extra time to get ready for school so i got all my textbooks ready and packed my lunch. got my shoes and backpack and set them in the hallway next to the door so i could grab them on the way out. with 30 extra minutes i sat down and looked at reddit. when the time came to leave i got my stuff and put on my backpack. it was... wet? at first i assumed it was just grape juice from my lunch, but when i gave it the old fasion sniff test i realized it was dog piss. my dog likes to pee in that hallway when nobody is awake to take her out at three in the mornging. while i was on reddit my backpack was soaking up the pee like a sponge. throughout the day people have been asking ""whats that smell?"" but no one has found out it was my backpack. everything in my backpack, or at least everything at the bottom, has a terrible piss oder to it. worst of all are my pencils, which i won't be lending out anymore.","layed down my backpack in dog piss, it became wet and has a terrible smell of urine, and has covered almost everything in my backpack."
686,"hey guys,

so this girl and i have become friends this past semester, as we are in the same class and sit together every day. i don't know everything about her, but still, i feel like an asshole for what happened earlier. 

so we agreed to meet in the library to get some work done together, and she was already there when i was coming in. i found where she was (i'm approaching from behind) and thought it would a great freaking idea if i went up and gently patted her on the shoulder to let her know i was there. 

fuck. that. she let out a huge shriek, alerting every one arounnd that i was, in fact, an asshole. plus, her friend was there too, great first impression to make too! now i know she doesn't handle surprise too well, but i still felt horrible...she said it was fine, but it's totally my fault. never pulling that stunt again with her, that's for sure.","tapped girl's shoulder in quiet library, broke the sound barrier."
687,"so we where in the ""pregnancy & birth"" part of the program and the topic was periods. in the video a narrator says ""during a womans period mucus and blood is expelled from the vagina"" and a friend of mine leaned over and said; ""bless you."". i just fucking lost it! i couldnt stop laughing for like 10 minutes! i had to go out in the hall and just giggle to myself for the last 5 of those 10 mins.",a friend of mine tells a joke in sex-ed and i had to leave the class because i was laughing so hard.

689,"not really today, but anyway, the story begins like this:

i was broke and hungry, and conveniently enough, my hometown was attempting to make the worlds largest single bowl of mussels. they got the record and were mighty happy with that (and so was guinness records). of course, they would give out the result for free, otherwise, there wouldn't be enough people to eat it all. as i was in a economic and metabolic limbo at the time (and a notorious big eater), i asked for two portions and said that the other one was for a friend (which, as you may have understood, was a lie). anyway, i was walking to the park in the nice and sunny weather and enjoying my delicious, free mussels. i finished my lovely meal, disposed of the leftovers and walked home and had a wank. 

later that evening, it turned out that poseidon was not happy with people who took double servings, and decided to punish me. i woke up around two in the night and felt feverish and a strong push from inside my bowels and down towards my poop-chute. i walked as fast as i could, sweating and naked to the restroom and thankfully made it in time. as i disposed of my refuse, i started feeling light-headed and started wiping. i then staggered like a massively drunken poop-smelling and sweating cripple and barely made it out the door before everything went white, then black. i woke up maybe half an hour later, with my numb chin on the stone floor. i rolled over to my back and took a finger slowly to my chin. i felt it go up about half an inch (1 cm-ish) into my skin and quickly took it out. after resting on the cold floor for a while, i got up and cleaned the wound and put on a band-aid. this was about half/three quarts a year ago and today, and i still have a little scar to remind me of the fierce powers of poseidon.",there is no such thing as a free lunch.**
690,"on friday, i took a bus from prague to budapest, though i was told it might terminate in bratislava due to bad weather. i went anyways. it terminated in bratislava, even though there conditions seemed fine, and i was surrounded by slovak and russian speakers aka nobody i understand.

i found a bus daring enough to venture into the land of magyars thanks to an irish? dude running and yelling bus to budapest, and we soon hit a non-moving traffic jam. for about 9 hours, we move an astounding 2km while giant industrial trucks drive past us the opposite way (at lightning fast 5km/hour or so). i call one of my friends, who tells me that the internet tells him tanks are being sent into the country to rescue people from snow- apparently 2. fucking. meters. of snow fell by the austria/hungary border. someone wound up giving birth in the traffic jam.

my bus driver didn't help by ignoring all of the police recommendations to stop driving and by driving on dark, icy roads. our whole bus wasn't sure we were going to live, let alone make it to budapest. we did arrive eventually, though, the next day.",snow results in 19 hour bus ride
691,"today, it's 2:30 am in the morning me and my friends go to waffle house, and indulge in some glorious waffles and other breakfast feasts.  feeling satisfied from the full course meal i just consumed i decide to sleep naked in all its glory and fall asleep.  while sleeping i have a dream of playing gta iv for some reason, and it's wierd cause i've never played that game in forever.  anyways in the dream i run a stop sign and end up getting shot and killed by a cop for it.  just keep saying in my head ""why the fuck did he shoot me?""  

next thing i know i'm awake with my throat burning, and i'm not breathing.  jump out of bed still not breathing and gasping for air to no avail i run through the house to my mother to aid me.  when i get to the kitchen fully naked i see my whole family enjoying sunday dinner, and not just my family today.  my grandmother and two of my aunts, and uncles are there too.  i just keep one hand on my dick while pointing to my throat and gasping for air. my mom asking freaking out with the phone in her hand debating to call 911 and asking me ""what is wrong?"" but i can not reply because of the lack of breath i am currently getting. 

finally the burn in my throat subsides and i can breath again. i immediately say ""i couldn't breath"" really loud and run to my room.  my mom pursues me in a chase to my room to see if i'm alright.  i then get dress and bring myself to the dinner table to eat with my family, but the dinner is awkward because one of my aunts will ask ""are you alright? we don't need to go to the doctor do we?"" and a minute later one of my uncles would be talking about how he was immersing himself into the glorious chicken feast before him and when he looked up all he saw was penis. it is a lunch that will be in my family for ages, if i just keep breathing.",i woke up not being able to breath and ran into the kitchen naked with my whole family eating dinner.
692,"so i was in desperate need to take a leak. no gas stations, hotels or restaurants in sight. my bladder was screaming for relief. i finally gave in. i was on the verge of pissing my pants when i spot a large flatbed tow truck parked on a street that was perfect for a clandestine public urination. i briefly look up into the cab, empty. i unbutton (more to that later), and start. suddenly i hear a voice...*from inside the truck!*

the driver was sitting back reclined on the phone. he sat up when he saw someone right next to his passenger door. we made eye contact. i used my pelvic floor muscles and turned away mid piss. 

as i walked off hastily i could not for the life of me get my dick back in my pants! i also could not re button them either. result? dick flashing a few cars and a pedestrian. oh god i hope there weren't any kids in those cars...

i finally get my dick back in my pants. i button up. and i start walking across the street. as fast as my shame can take me. that is when i notice the warm rush, then cold of dribble. and not just a little post pee dribble that we are all familiar with. but full on ""look, that guy pissed himself!""

fuck.

to make matters worse, i am wearing acu army pants. so the patch is darker than the rest of the trousers. oh, and i still had to pee desperately.","tried to take a public piss on a truck, surprised driver, while fleeing dick flashed people and got a healthy amount of urine on pants in daylight.**"
693,"once, i was an avid runner. i had slowly worked my way up to 10k with a decent time and was proud. all throughout smoking half a pack of reds daily, drinking far too much cheap bourbon nightly and eating poorly because it all seemed to balance out. well sometime last summer i injured my knee. the doctor's response was to have me not put unnecessary strain on it. i stopped running, but continued smoking, drinking and eating poorly. today, a good six months later i decided to go out for a run. i dug out my warm woolen socks, homemade ipod armband, and the shiny new runners i had bought as a treat just before my injury. i began my old route and all was wonderful; the sun rising over the flats turned wildlife preserve where i had always ran, birds singing in the trees, the raconteurs blasting in my ears... my viscera felt animated once again. at about 9k, i could tell something was wrong. i had felt a little funny earlier but chalked it up to the acidic costa rican coffee to which i woke. at 9.5 i was woozy and had to stop dead. i learned up on a telephone pole and felt as though a wave had just crashed against me. not a pleasant warm caribbean ocean wave. a bone chilling, gut wrenching, tidal bastard, hell-bent on tearing me to shreds. somehow, and quite simultaneously, i managed to both vomit and shit myself. luckily, being a quiet early morning sunday in the suburbs, nobody was around to witness my fuck up, save the sheepdog who belonged to the yard i threw up in, and his judgmental eyes. the taste of the coffee's green apple acidity bursting up from my innards, down the telephone pole and onto my shiny new trainers will not be something i'll soon forget. i walked the last half k in shame, the runny unpleasantness contained loosely in my boxers, the stink of failure on my breath. 

reset the counter.","ran 10k, puked, and shit myself.**"
694,"i made a throwaway thinking i wouldn't need it but today is one of those days.

okay, so i was coming back to my apartment when i remembered my roommate's boyfriend was going to be there with her. i didn't plan on coming back but my date ended badly. so anyway i come inside when i feel a huge urge to fart so i went to the bathroom to release the kracken. 

you know those farts? where you can feel if its going to be a huge one? yeah, i considered holding it in but one step too big and my ass wouldn't be able to keep it in. and if i just went into the bathroom and let it all out there was no doubt they would hear it, and kill the mood. so i thought, 'hey, if you spread your ass apart, it won't be so loud.'

ugh.

since i was just coming back from a date i was wearing a high-waisted skirt, and those don't really allow you to spread your legs, as mine was really tight. 

so i take off this shirt, widen my stance, bend over, and use my hands to spread my ass apart and fart.

almost silent.

just as i finish, bam.

door is open. my roommate walks in. i guess she didn't know i came in, as our bathroom is right next to the front door.

well there i am, bent over legs apart picking my skirt off the ground. and instead of covering up, i fucking freeze where i am. i was fucking *mortified* because she is seeing me, in all my glory.

she quickly stammered, ""oh uh, sorry, uhm, bye."" and shut the door. i put my skirt on, and was met with an awkward silence as i walked past them in the living room to my room.

i could die right now. i'm almost positive she told him. i don't know what to tell her if she asks. i can't even face her anymore.","didn't want to disturb roommate and boyfriend, so i spread my ass to silence a fart as my roommate walks in."
695,"so last night my roommate and i were bored and decided we would play a drinking game. we found a typical template for a drinking game based around the show the league. needless to say, like most of these games, it's impossible to finish an episode without nearly dying of alcohol poisoning. ten shots of vodka later, my roommate and i find ourselves stumbling about for a couple hours, talking to friends and what not. we were enjoying the drunken bliss. 

in the state i was in i quickly lost track of the whereabouts of my roomie and went on a search to find him. as i stumble back to the room an incredible desire to shit begins to take hold of me. now to paint the picture of this dorm, our room is literally 5 feet from the bathroom. however, my drunken brain convinced me that i would not make that distance and so i was left with one option... hanging off his bed post was his open backpack, and it is there that i proceeded to unload a torrent of vicious, alcohol induced sludge that nearly filled the poor bag to the brim. it blacks out from there and next thing i know i am in the bathroom stall bracing against the walls as the room spins and collapse around me. all i have on is a soggy pair of shit smeared boxers tangled around my ankles as i desperately try to go to the bathroom. then i feel like i'm going to throw up. in what can only be described as an astoundingly coordinated shifting of my body i managed to throw up into the toilet. i must say at this point, for all of the bodily fluids coming out of me i managed to keep them contained well. not a drop of shit hit the floor. by this time i make it back to the room and the roommates back. i collapse onto my bed and pass out. 

by the time i wake up it is nearly noon and i notice a very distinct smell. up until this point i had totally forgotten what i had done. then i remember... i spring up and this wakes up my roommate. ""what is that smell?"" he asks. ""it smells like shit..."" i get up and as i walk about the room i already know what i've done. yet, i still check the trash cans hoping that maybe, just maybe i didn't really do it. they are both empty and as we slowly approach the backpack a look ambivalence spread across his face. he described it as being perversely impressed. impressed that i managed not to shit on the floor, upset that it was in his backpack. luckily he had removed his books so the only damage was to the backpack itself. however, his wallet that was in the front pouch managed to absorb the liquid shit and now retains a distinctive odor of ass slop. 

we decided to throw the bag away... i was also now required to replace not only the bag but also the wallet. i gave him my extra backpack and in my spare time made him a pretty banging duct tape wallet. and i had to ride a bike 2 miles in order to get him chipotle while hungover and practically vomiting the whole way there and back.","-> i got drunk, shit in my roommates backpack and had to make him a duct tape wallet"
696,"first of all, this wasn't actually today, it was when i was 10.

anyways, i was being a good kid, helping my mom cut up peppers to make summer salad. (bell pepers, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and some godly greek dressing stuff.) i was hollowing out a green bell peper of all the white-ish stuff on the inside, including the seeds. right after i finished, it was all pretty, ready to start getting diced up.

here comes the stupidity

being the dumb fuck 10 year old i was, i decide i'm gonna put water in the hollowed out pepper and act like it's a coconut or some shit *and drink out of it*. so according to myself, this plan was flawless. i go over to the sink with my ""cup"" in hand, and fill it up. my mother was still cutting, she didn't see any of this devious plan.

fill up the pepper, take a sip.. oh dear god, why. i don't know what it was that made it taste as disgusting as it did, but something sure did. i spit it out everywhere. it doesn't sound like it would be that bad, but the taste was absolutely horrendous.","hollowed out a green bell pepper, made it my awesome cup and drank out of it. was fucking disgusting."
697,"this story is hard for me tell i have so much shame....my wife and i are proud parents to a seven month old son. we want more kids soon but aren't ready just yet and my wife can't  take birth control so we have to use condoms around her ovulation time. last night i come home from work to find my wife waiting for me in bed with no clothes, a come hither look and a condom sitting on my pillow. i immediately get hard as a rock, tear off my clothes roll the condom onto my dick climb into bed and give the little lady a hurtin. well after said copulation we are both worn out i pull off the condom and throw it in a trash can that my wife keeps next to the bed, get up take a piss and we watch some netflix for awhile before falling asleep.

flash forward to today...i get home from work and i am tired but the wife needs to run to the store and asks me to watch our son. i am a little pissed cause i get up really early in the morning and when i get home i just want to unwind but whatever i""ll watch him. i bring him in our room, (which by the way is our bed two night stands, a dresser and a floor lamp and aforementioned trash can) put some toys on the floor put him next to them, put up a baby gate in our doorway and climb into our bed turn on the tv. after about ten minutes of looking at the tv and keeping an eye on our son i start to drift off...suddenly i wake up with a start. i look at the clock and realize it was only a couple minutes later. i immediately look down for my son. he is laying on his stomach with his back to me. i decide to get down on the floor and play with him cause i know if his mom gets home and sees me laying in the bed with him on the floor she is going to be like why weren't you spending time with him? as i get closer i say my son's name and he turns around to look at me. the horror i see almost makes me instantly puke...he is chewing on my used dong bag. in the two minutes i fell asleep he had knocked the trash can over and gotten into the garbage. i run up to him screaming no son that is dirty! i yank it out of his mouth which of course makes him scream so i pick him up and try to calm him down. after he calms i take him into the bathroom wipe his brothers and sisters off his face (yep you heard that right) put him back near his toys pick up the trash and vow to never tell my wife.",fell asleep baby chews used condom
698,"i just started a new job and have been a little stressed about work. so last friday i left work at the end of the day and needed gas. i stopped at a gas station, pre paid inside and began pumping gas.  my windshield wiper fluid box has a leak so my windshield is constantly dirty. while my gas was pumping i used the scrub thing to clean my windshield. finished, got in my car, drove away...  with the gas hose still in my car.  it ripped the hose out. after 20 minutes of the gas station attendent calling me an idiot, taking my information, and telling me they just had that pump fixed the day before, i was on my way. so on my way home from work today i was running low on gas.  you guessed it; i did the same exact fucking thing.  in a matter of 6 days, i managed the same dumbass move, twice.",i'm an idiot
699,"setup: i had recently purchased a new cock ring. this is something i thought she may enjoy. to make sure it was the right size and so forth i experimented with it solo a few days before hand. all was well. size was perfect. did the job it was suppose to do. feeling confident the gf would enjoy it.

fast forward to sexy time with the gf. i got my the ring out and put it on my flaccid cock. had my gf kneel in front of me for oral pleasure. things are going well and my cock is growing and the ring is starting to do it's job. my cock is getting pretty engorged at this point and my gf can't fit it in her mouth anymore. i tell her to lay down so i can fuck her. i climb on top of her and she is dripping wet. i slide my engorged cock in her and we have some pretty awesome, rough sex. she loves the way it feels and i am pleased with my purchase at this point. things are going well and i am super turned on with her reaction to my throbbing, thick cock. orgasms for both of us and i pull out and try to slide the ring off. 

i am still prety turned on and since the ring is doing it's job so well, it's a little difficult to slide off. eventually the ring comes off and my cock is a little sore. i pay no attention to the discomfort and lay down next to my gf for cuddles. quick nap and i wake up to a dull ache in my groin area. i look down and it looks like my cock has been beat on by mike tyson. it's bruised and looks like i may have a varicose vein now. it's not so painful as much as it aches. plus, it's ugly as fuck. gf thinks it's funny. kinda is.","left cock ring on too long, bruised cock, gf thinks it's funny"
700,"so no one is home, i do what every teenager who is well raised with a loving family and a nice home would do, i load up some sweet mobile pornhub and go for a quiet one in the toilet as i want no mess, and easy clean up and i have a busy day ahead of me. so there i am spanking it to a milf getting pummelled by a black guy, and it's going well. the wank is just about to end smoothly, so all my attention is focused on having the most pleasurable climax possible, and the grip on my iphone begins to weaken, and as i valiantly let out a ripper of a jizz, my phone slips from the firm grip that once was, catches a bit of jizz on the way down, bounces around the bowl and falls into a pool of toilet water and 10am cum. the screen goes blank, the gorgeous milf that was taking 10 inches just to pleasure me disappears into darkness, and my recently purchased $600 phone, with no insurance dies with it.",having a snappy with phone in hand in the toilet and i drop it in as i cum.
701,so i go to a great school and am far behind due to a long medical leave of absence. i came back trying to internally transfer to the business school and needed to get a 3.0 gpa in order to do so. i just got my grades back today and found out that i got 3 b's and a b- to give me a 2.97 gpa. i didn't get in and will have to withdraw out of the university because i cannot afford to start fresh in another major. the worst part about it is that in one of my classes i got a 87.25% which is .25 points away from rounding up to an 88% which would give me the 3.0 gpa i need to get in to the business school. now i have a shit load of student loan debt with not degree to help me pay it off.,i am dropping out of college because i am .25 points short in getting into the major that i completely invested myself into.
702,"so i'm typing this now because i couldn't use my right arm on thursday.

i'm in highschool gym class and we are playing football, its only second period and the grass we are on is still wet from the morning dew. i am a distance runner but we have to play football to get a grade. just playing, i sprint after this guy going for the touch down, i miss him, i slip right on my behind about five feet and hurt my left wrist. no big deal, just walked it off. kept playing. coach wasn't watching so we started tackling. one of the guys who was on football just starts rolling down midfield like a freight train. i get the bright idea in my head, skinny, runner me says ""i can stop him"". i run at him full speed, he doesn't see me, we connect!

i don't remember getting hit but i hear i had air time. couple seconds later i land on my right arm and my left wrist, again. i get up really quickly and my collar bone feels wrong immediately. ""hey derp, are you ok?"" the others ask. i feel the collar bone, definitely broken. fast forward, nurse's office, nurse looks at me, nurse calls mom, mom takes me to er, totally out of it at this point. they give me two shots of morphine in both arms, but they can't give me a lot because i have never had a strong painkiller before, or been in a hospital. the x- ray at this point has confirmed my collarbone is broken, so they get this medieval torture device that will hold my shoulder in place. nearly pass out. i get some time to contemplate the fact that me and my right hand are gonna have a hard time doing finals. i also got a wrist brace and a sling for my right arm when i am up and about. it seems to be healing but going to the restroom, showering, washing my hands, eating, taking a dump (is extremely agonizing), coughing, sneezing, and even laughing hurts. balls.

 

edit: yeah and cross country practice is gonna start again soon, and i can't go to practice now either.",i tried to block a football player running at full speed and broke my right collarbone and sprained my left wrist before finals.
703,"this actually happened last week, but i only discovered this subreddit a few days ago, so yeah.

anyway, i'm currently a senior in college and have only had one serious girlfiend in that time. as far as i can determine, the reason for my lack of a relationship is a combination of things. these being: i'm shy, i'm kind of an asshole, i can never take a hint, i always assume the girl likes someone else. basically, i'm a person who sabotages himself.

anyway, there's this girl, she shall thus be known as m, that i've known for a few years now and though we've been friends that whole time, we only really started hanging out a lot a few months ago. we eat lunch together every day and enjoy each other's company. we also tell each other about our lives and the goings-on in them and try and give each other advice to get through problems we may be having. i could go on, but i won't.

last weekend, i invited her over to my place to watch some movies and drink some wine together. she says it sounds like a good idea and comes over. the night starts out pretty normally with us talking a bit and then watching a movie. soon enough, the wine is broken out and we go through 2 bottles in relatively short order. at this point, given that we are both light-weights, we're pretty drunk. we proceed to talk about how our romantic lives are shitty and how we just haven't been able to find the perfect person yet even though we've been trying. m has actually dated people and tried to find good relationships while i've just been a shy loser and wished i'd date more. as the night goes on, we talk about ourselves and how we see ourselves and how we see each other's personalities. this leads to talking about what our ideal partners are like and lo and behold, we seem to be describing each other. what i mean is, everything we'd said about ourselves was being used to describe our ideal partners.

being the oblivious idiot that i am, i had also failed to notice that she had been moving closer to me on the couch (or had i been moving closer to her? i don't really know, i was kind of drunk). there were lots of moments where we would stare at each other and not say anything though once again, this may be attributed to the drunkenness.

throughout the night, i'd thought about leaning over and kissing her, but i couldn't bring myself to do it because being me, the only thing i could think of was how she probably didn't even like me and how she probably just considered me a close friend that she could talk to about anything. she left about 5 hours after arriving to go out to bars with some other friends of hers.

now, all i do is think about how i should have at least tried to kiss her and seen how things turned out. if it worked, awesome, if not, less awesome, but at least i'd know.

704,"so today i was playing golf with some friends, having a great time and all until i come across a baby turtle that had somehow flipped over in the middle of the fairway. it was pretty hot outside (75-80) so i thought, ""fuck it, i'm saving this little guy."" so i pick up this baby turtle, and walk with it for the rest of the hole until i show my friends and share ideas of what we will do with it. all my friends suggestions were shit so i just went with my own idea which was to put him in the nearby pond so maybe he can find some other turtles and start a new life. i drop him 2-3 feet off of a small bridge into the water, small tears coming from my eyes, and wish the little guy the best of luck in his new life. walking away, i turn around to see him still in his shell, not moving about 1 foot underwater. i wait for him to come out of his shell and swim off, but he  won't come out and still stays in the same place. after a couple of minutes, his shell turns upside down, and sinks to the bottom. i still to this hour have no idea if he was fucking with me or i had just drowned a baby turtle.","tried to save a baby turtle by putting him in a pond, drowned the son of a bitch"
705,"i planted some grass seed last week and had to water it. i also bought a pocket hose, because although i am neither 5 nor 75 years old, i *am* a lady who does not enjoy lugging 50 pounds of garden hose around the fucking yard. judge me. 

anyway, i figured this would take all of 5 minutes and since the patch is close to the back door of my house, i didn't bother putting a bra on beneath my white t-shirt. you can all see where this is going, right? i attached the hose and tightly screwed my spray nozzle into place. the pocket hose has a lever on the end which opens the valve, which i had set to off. precautions, man: i swear i took 'em all - except possibly the best one, which would have been not buying a hose with plastic connnections. 

i turned on the water, raised the hose, hit the lever... and the connector for the sprayer nozzle immediately rocketed off into space - but before it did, it had the comedic decency to blast a jet of freezing fucking water right across the front of my t-shirt.

annnd at that minute, the next-door neighbor rounded the corner of his house and was met with an unobstructed view of my high beams. so that was fun.

fuck you, pocket hose. why are your connections even plastic.","wet t-shirt party in my yard, courtesy of a fucking hose i bought on television. how do you like dem nipples, mister neighbor?**"
706,"my girlfriend and i went to a party tonight, but took separate cars since i  was heading there from home and she went there straight from work.  on the way home, we were at a stop light next to each other and decided to have a drag race, totally not noticing that there was a cop a couple cars behind us.  right when i hit the 45 mph speed limit and let off the gas, i saw the lights behind us.

""both cars pull over"" blared from the cop car.

fuck me.  here comes the several hundred dollar fine combined with my insurance rates going sky high if i'm lucky, potential arrest for reckless driving if i'm unlucky.

apparently, we were really lucky.  the cops had us both step out of our cars and he just gave us a short lecture about safer driving at night.  i think they were amused because they were expecting two teenagers showing off, not a 30-year old couple driving home.  my girlfriend said that when the cop asked her what she was doing, she said ""flirting?""

 

edit: in case anyone cares, i won the race but not by much.  she drives a subaru outback, powered by a 3.0 liter h6 engine, versus my suzuki esteem, with a 1.8l 4-banger.  she has a lot more power (212 hp vs 122 hp), but also a ton more weight (3715 lbs vs 2385 lbs).","had a street race with my girlfriend, got caught by cops, only got a short lecture"
707,"so this guy asked me to be his boyfriend. a heated, tension-filled conversation ensued. eventually,  i turned him down. after all of this, he asked me an unrelated question. i planned on finding out the answer, and so i intended to respond with the phrase ""one sec."" so, apparently, android doesn't recognize ""sec"" as an adequate phrase. but in its mind, a proper replacement would be the word ""sex."" so after turning down this guy, i responded ""one sex."" he thought i was asking for a one night stand. i can't even. and then, he responded saying he would love that. i wasn't sure if i was supposed to embarass him more, or what, so i just said nevermind, cause, you know, yolo and shit. i ended up panicking and blocking his number. that is all.","i spent five minutes on this. read it, dammit."

709,"this was actually sunday, but who's counting? 


this past sunday a coworker and friend of mine got married. beautiful ceremony, right on tampa bay etc etc.

open bar weddings are my favorite.

i get pretty shitty at the reception along with a lot of other people. we closed the club/restaurant down and a sizable group of us are looking to get into some more trouble. including most of the bridal party. we go back to the hotel, more drinks, then walk to another hotel which had a bar still open in it. more drinks etc.

next thing i fucking know i'm getting out of a car in front of one of the nicer strip clubs in town (as far as i know anyway) called 2001 odyssey... sci-fi is cool right? anyway, i was there with two of the groom's friends, that i hardly know at all. we'd met a few weeks prior for the bachelor party weekend in ft.lauderdale.

so we go in and immediately are picked up by a girl each. now at this point, i don't remember seeing the two other dudes again. the next thing i remember is i'm in a private room with this very hot, young, stripper. she looks like the kind of girl i would like to date. wasn't a porn start or anything like. she was just really beautiful etc. anyway prior to going into the room, i vaguely remember a conversation about this costing $400, which i wasn't too concern with.

later on when things were going down that same other girl comes back in and explains some other charge to me (i have no idea what, but i just agreed with everything they asked me) my girl takes a break at some point to go get something, and that's when i pulled out my phone and text my best friend ""i think i'm at a strip club""... that was the last i remember seeing me phone.

she comes back in, things resume, whatever. 

next thing i know i'm being walked outside by the bouncer as they're closing up and i was the last one there. i get helped to a cab and get whisked off into the night... or so you'd think.

i dont remember the conversation, but, apparently i was talking over payment with the cab driver and he pulled over... directly across the street from the strip club, at another strip club -_-

i couldn't find my debit card, i had no cash... i think i tried to pay him with my expired gamestop rewards card. i'm not sure why he wouldn't take it. needless to say, i got out of the cab and contemplated life while sitting on a bench outside of a strip club.


i couldn't have been there more than just a few minutes when i realized the situation was hopeless and i just needed to get home. so i started walking.


i'll spare you the explanation of tampa locale and whatnot but, suffice it to say i ended up walking along the interstate for a few miles. i nearly crossed the howard frankland bridge when a white truck pulls over on the side of the road.


apparently this dude, name was joey i think, was on his way home from work (it's about 6-7 something in the morning at this point) and wanted to give me a ride home. i hopped in and off we went. he had to make a stop at his apartment (i stayed in the truck as he went in, and was gone for maybe about a minute) we got back on the road and we're just chatting, talking about how people are just not kind these days and how i was really appreciative of him giving me a lift. not too far down the road from his place, he asks me if i smoke weed. i do and he proceeded to light up a blunt and we just continue on chatting, smoking etc. 

i have him drop me off at the entrance to my neighborhood as i didn't want some stranger knowing where i live. at this point i finally realize i don't have my phone, he helps me look for it in the truck, to no avail. 

i get inside my house and realize not only am i out my phone and credit card, but, i've also lost my drivers license.

i've managed to get my license/debit card back. it turns out i took one of those guys suit jacket before we even got to the strip club and i put all of that shit in the jacket pockets. they wanted to leave but i was emphatic about staying and i gave him his jacket back. still no phone though. sucks, i'd just gotten that new phone (iphone 5) and i paid for it outright, so i could keep my unlimited data plan with verizon. so unless i can recover the phone, i'm out ~$1000 for that as well.","got way too drunk at a wedding/after, spent almost $2000 at a strip club, and lost my new iphone 5, debit card, and drivers license."
710,"my daughters birthday is coming up so we decided to make a pinata out of cardboard. well taping it wasn't working so we decided to hot glue some of the places that the tape didn't want to stay on. well hot glue dribbled down the side so i used my finger, like the genius i am, to stop it from running all over the pinata. it really hurt so i put it up to my lip...now i have a piece of my lip burnt off and my finger is starting to bubble. i really don't know why i put it up to my mouth. i guess i wanted to stop the pain lol please forgive me if this sounds like crap, this literally just happened and i can't type well.","hot glue dribbled so i used my finger to stopped it, it hurt so i put it up to my mouth to stop the pain. i'm pretty sure some of my lip is on my finger. :("
711,"first off, this was back when i was probably 10.  

it all started when my friends came over and we pulled an all-nighter. we were in the basement watching tv. the show we were watching ended and we started changing the channels to find something else to watch. my friend's older brother, who i think was 12 at the time had the remote. he found a porn channel. it was the first time i had ever seen porn.

all i could think of for the next couple days was boobs. so not knowing the term porn and not having easy access to a computer, i decided to draw my own ""porn"".

so i had the drawing and hid it under my pillow. the next morning i had soccer/football, and while i was gone, my mom cleaned my room. she changed the pillow case and found my drawing under the pillow right as i came home. she looked at me furiously and said we'll talk about it later. she left the drawing and left the room. i immediately took it, ripped it up and threw it in multiple garbage cans. we have never spoken of this incident since. my mom has a good memory, so i wouldn't be surprised if she still remembers.

td;lr: watched porn at a young age, didn't know what it was. made a drawing of a naked woman, mom found it.",at the bottom
712,"i had only met this girl a few times and thought she was totally hot. she initiates the exchanging of numbers so i decided it is a good enough sign to ask her out for some drinks and dancing. she is down and i of course am stoked. i have really no idea who this girl is at this point as we have maybe had 10 minutes of conversation. date starts at 9 with some drinks and then i take her to a gay club for dancing. this club is known for being a fun dance club that gets a little out of control once things get going with no judgment befalling anybody. my awkward white boy dancing fits right in! we get there at 10 and nobody is even there yet, let alone dancing. so we end up just talking for another hour and a half. come to find out this girl is actually really smart and funny! we are also starting to get faded. a friend of hers joins us at the club and dancing starts. i am feeling great and dancing with two amazingly hot women. felt great. as the drinks keep going and the night goes on i start to get wild with my date on the dance floor. i am not sure what constitutes wild for you but for me i have never been so pornographic on a dance floor in public. i was grabbing her ass. i was grabbing her tits. she was getting supper into it and grinding me with so much force that i had to lean forward to support us. all of a sudden it is 2 am and the three of us walk home to my place down the street. all of us were way to drunk to drive. my intent was to sleep with her. that left my mind during the night because i was having so much fun just talking and dancing that i forgot about sex. also on the walk home i start to worry about my impending 9 am shift. i was not planning staying until the club closed at 2. when i got us all home i set the girls up with a place to sleep, i had also not anticipated her friend so i thought i was doing the right thing by getting them both set up and comfortable. i head off to my room and think thats that. my date came into my room on her own! she wanted to sleep with me in my bed instead of out in our living room. at this point i fucked up by inviting her into my bed just to sleep. i realize now the wide open huge opportunity i missed. like a minute after she gets in the bed she seems all confused. at this point i am just thinking of the 5 hours of sleep i am about to get and that i might still be drunk when i go off to work. she asks me why i asked her out and if this was a “first date.” i kind of just agree not realizing that she was newly single and not looking for a boyfriend, which i just implied was my intention. two days later i text her to see if she wants to hang out and she lays it out to me that she is not interested in me.",took a hot girl out that was down to hook up. i enjoyed our time together to much and missed the opportunity.
713,"so last night i decided it was time to whip out the ol' bongowski. three hours and 5 rips later i decided to get one of the best pizzas ever from the shop just behind my house. spicy buffalo chicken. 

now mind you i had some grade a stuff so i walked into place with shades on. (it was 9 at night) on my way back i prop that bad boy on the table and take in the heavenly aroma, but then i thought ""you know what would make this better? cheese fries!"" sadly, the pizza place serves no fries (what kinda pizza places doesn't sell fries ffs?) so i went to the burger shop right next to it. the fries was a fast 1m order; out the frier, poored liquid gold ontop, and in the box.

so now i'm ready to have the greatest meal of my life and before i even know it, everything is cleaned. no more fries, no pizza, no anything, and then it hit me. 

i had no drink.

i go to the fridge to make me some strawberry milk and end my day only to be rudely awoken hours later by an angry stomach. i run to bathroom and release yesterdays lunch in a mighty push of hiroshima proportions. 

i pooped at least 5 times within 2hrs of waking up and have had horrible gas ever since.","got high and ate a medium pizza, cheese fries, and a whole glass of strawberry milk and am paying heavily for it"
714,"i bake fairly often, and i decided to make brownies today. i got all the ingredients together, preheated the oven, and even added chocolate chips to the brownies to make them extra special. 30 minutes later, i pulled the brownies out of the oven and saw it was bubbling. confused, i thought about what might've caused it before i realized i never added flour. now i have chocolate goop.","made brownies, forgot flour."
715,"this happened last night, but i figure it's been less than 24 hours, so it's still today. 
last night, i was hanging out with a few people from my floor. we had a guy bring alcohol, so i got a little buzz going. this guy, who is roommate to a female hallmate's boyfriend, says he has weed. he asked if we wanted to smoke with him. i, having never smoked weed and alays wanting to try it, said yes. me, him, my roommate, & our hall mate and boyfriend all go up to a secluded area (our rooms have smoke alarms) and start to light up. i was already a little off, but the weed took me to a whole new place. i mean i was walking on air, and i wasn't right. 
i was feeling pretty good and my roommate mentioned making him laugh. i remembered a joke about an pakistani and a doctor from r/meanjokes and i figured ""eh, why not tell it?""
it turns out that the guy is half indian. i told it and he told me that i shouldn't tell that to people. after i found out he was half indian, i apologized profusely. i still feel bad about it.","got drunk, got high, told a racist joke to an ethnic man, blaming r/meanjokes"
716,"i'm on a road trip to another state with my husband. we are driving late tonight for many hours, and i decided to switch driving with him at a little restaurant. while there, i decide hey, we could use a little coffee, so why not grab some for us? we buy the coffee and get in the car (husband is driving now), and start slugging our drinks on the highway. at first everything is going well as it's a beautiful full moon and the roads are clear, when about 10 minutes into the drive i feel unusually tired and lethargic. over the next half hour i go from sleepy,  tired, reclining in the seat, to finally nauseous and begging my husband to pull over at a stopping point. before we even reach the hotel main drive i tell him to stop the car...i get out and with as much dignity as i can muster, embrace the moment and become a vomit factory. instantly i feel better, and am now recovering in the hotel for the night. after wracking my brain, i remember that at our previous stopping point to the little restaurant, i had popped my lithium pill for my mood disorder. after a quick google search, it was immediately apparent that i am a big dum-dum who should pay more attention to the side effects of mixing caffeine and lithium, such as intense nausea and vomiting. oops.

i doubt i'll be getting laid tonight though, husband was definitely put off when i got back in the car smiling and asked if he wanted to see my dinner again.",caffeine + lithium = vomit storm
717,"ok this didn't actually happen today, or to me for that matter.  but it happened to my brother when smash brothers was brand new on the 64.  you will likely enjoy this.

so me and my brother were chillin out and shit, i was 11ish and he was 9ish.  we got extremely giddy playing smash brothers and were going absolutely ape shit, like two little boys with adhd are expected to.  this was especially aided by the fact that my father thought medication was total bullshit and instead fed us candy on the regular.  my brother was continuously farting like a anal maniac demon, nothing surprising or unusual here.  he also kept pausing the game and being all like ""i gotta use the bathroom brb nigga"".  i dealt with it for a while, i really did, but holy fuck!!!  super smash brothers is just so fun.  eventually my microscopic amount of adolescent patience ran out, he tried to leave and i said ""dude, you just went, man.  just keep playin for a minute and see what happens.""  his response, ""k"".  moments later, i hear the funniest, longest, loudest fart of my life (and i've got some experience in this shit).  this time i paused the game to watch after the fart surpassed a few seconds in duration.  i was fully engrossed in this, it was impressive and disturbing.  at first, he didn't seem to give a shit, like it was some kind of normal fart.  but suddenly, his body became erect and his eyes widened, he opened his mouth to a perfect circular o shape.  he held this stance for a few seconds.  when the ass rampage was over he said solemnly, yet with a sense of urgency, was ""uh-oh"".  i began laughing harder than i could tolerate, literally, i couldn't stop or think it was so god damned funny.  he got up and sprinted up the stairs .  only a few seconds later, i hear my dad shout ""you did what in your pants!?!?""  every time i remember this happening i giggle.",chronic wailing farts turn into massive blow hole burnout
718,"last night i went to a bar with some friends. it was ""penny pitchers"" aka really cheap beer for college students. i was tired and didn't feel like being out late so i drove there with the intention of driving home later. 

after an hour or so, one of my buddies convinced me to stay out longer and said the parking lot was 24 hour parking on weekends so i didn't have to worry about leaving it there all night. i obliged.

now, after a lot of drinks and several hours later, i am obliterated. i stumble to my friend's house after some pizza and pass out. the next morning my friend drove me back to the lot to get my car; but it wasn't there. oh, by the way, because i parked right next to the bar, i left everything in it including coat, purse and wallet with debit cards.

like magic, a sign that i swear wasn't there last night appeared, mocking me and chanting ""parking until 7am."" i called the tow company that was advertised below the tormenting sign and learned they had my car. my angel of a roommate drove me to the lot in the middle of ghetto downtown. since i left everything in my car the night before i had to retrieve my debit cards first, find a bank, take out $120 in cash, go back to the tow-yard, pay and get my baby back. 

and this is the exact moment my hangover decides to kick in. yep, i start yacking right in the parking lot of the tow company that took away my car. it was the lowest point in my college life. 

i rush home, barely make it through the door before i start spewing again for the next 15 minutes.","car got towed, threw up in lot, lowest point in life realized.**"
719,"this happened yesterday. i should've known it's gonna be a bad day when my younger kitty, while jumping around in the kitchen, knocked over a big bell jar and smashed it to pieces. 

i had bought tickets for myself and the girlfriend to a play on broadway in early january. the performance was for friday evening, which is when nemo decided to hit nyc. we ended up not being able to go for the play. i had gotten the tickets through nyu (important later) at a discount, but they were still about a hundred bucks. since my so doesn't really enjoy broadway that much and can't afford tickets (neither can i, but that's a separate issue), the deal is that i buy her ticket too if i want her to come with me. 

anyway, i checked on the theater's website to see if they offered a refund or a switch for tickets, since i figured a lot of people would get caught out by nemo and miss the play. sure enough, they had a notice saying that you could buy a new set of tickets for some other date, email them with the order details and the previous ticket details, and they'll issue a refund. so yesterday (saturday), i bought tickets for the evening show again (this time, no discount, so even more expensive tickets), and emailed telecharge (the company that handles the ticket sales) for a refund on the tickets i had gotten through nyu. at this point, i decided to call nyu to get the order details, in case telecharge needed specific order numbers or something; nyu told me that they don't get their tickets through telecharge! they said that i should take my tickets for friday to the theater and ask them to give me new tickets to a different date. that effectively means that nyu won't refund my tickets, nor will telecharge. 

so now, i had two sets of tickets to the same play. i tried selling the ones for yesterday's performance on craigslist, but no one bit. so, we decided we might as well go to the play and enjoy what we can. 

we reach the theater and sit down. it's ten minutes to curtains when i realize. . . **i left the fucking oven on.** it was empty, so there was no risk of food burning, but it had already been on two hours when we were home. it's an old gas oven. i was pre-heating it to make food when my girlfriend got home from work, and i got distracted and forgot about it. i panicked and called the super who lives in the building and left him a voicemail to call me asap. he's a douche who never answers his phone, but i digress. we decide that there's not that much of a risk of a fire, since it's an empty oven, and that we should just see the play and then go home. so the play starts and we sit through the first act, all the while i'm thinking about the fucking oven in my head. at intermission, i finally get a call back from my super. when i tell him about the oven, he freaks out and tells me to hurry home instantly, since these old fucking ovens can't be relied on and something might melt and start a fire. sigh. . . we leave the play and rush home and thankfully, nothing bad had happened. 

so now, i have a second set of tickets to the play that we can use to go and finish watching it, but i have to sell them, because i'm too poor to be able to afford two sets of tickets to a play right now. 

 

**edit: formatting and stuff.**",fuck my luck. fuck my stupidity. fuck craigslist. fuck my super. fuck me.**
720,"so it's a typical friday on january term, it's 1pm, i'm done with classes for the day, and i'm in my room by myself. my roommate usually doesn't come into the room until 5 pm or 12am, because ya know, social shit. so i'm just paroozin on reddit when i go ""hey, i got a shit ton of time to beat it, and the internet is pretty fast today, so might as well enjoy myself"" so i end up spending at least 30 minutes just finding porn clips to look at, because when else will get the opportunity to watch em (my college is in the middle of nowhere). 

it should also be worth noting what kind of set up i had going on at this point. i'm laying on my bed (because if you ain't jerkin it while chillin on some 350 thread count sheets, you ain't doing it it right) with a t-shirt and some boxers on,a tissue on my pillow and the door is locked.

now just as i'm starting to really get into it, i hear some activity around my hallway, not too strange, it's the early afternoon, of course people are going to be moving. the moving continues, but now it's distinctly moving around my room (my room is right across from the bathroom) so i think to myself ""that doesn't necessarily mean it's my roommate, might as well keep going"" so i do. right as i've found the perfect porn clip, and i'm just about to blow, i hear the lock being undone to my door, and there's this moment where time slows down, in which i have to question everything that has ever happened in my life, and how the fuck this happening makes any sense. i quickly make a grab for the tissue on my pillow, but it's too late, my roommate has swung open the door. i make sure to calm my body as much as possible while jizzing near 40 minutes worth of build up underneath me, with my left hand holding my head up, my right hand balled up into a fist so the tissue isn't visible, and the blanket up to my belly button at this point.

my roommate immediately turns to me and goes ""ya know what's the worst part about parking tickets?"" thankfully i'm still able to think with the processing power of a person in a normal situation and reply ""paying them?"" he says that he would of added the word fucking in there, but that i got the basic sentiment right. he then turns his back on me and goes to the other side of the room as he rifles through a box to find some spare cash. i lay in the now sticky pile, trying to wedge the tissue underneath me as i realize that both my boxers and sheets are pretty much screwed for the rest of the day. i end up laying there for 15 minutes before he decides to take a shower.","thought i had all the time in the world to masturbate, roommate walked in at the exact moment i came, ended up cumming on self and sheets."
721,"my latest fu is probably pretty tame compared to many here (read: no shitting involved), but still i feel like i need to get this off my chest.  i apologize for the wall of text--this kind of got away from me, and believe it or not, i actually trimmed stuff out).

long winded prelude:  there is a girl who works at my local grocery store that i have found myself enamored with since i first laid eyes on her.  it's more than just her physical appearance, call it an aura or vibe, there's just something inexplicable about her that has really caught me.  it's been a long time since i've had feelings like that stirred up in me.

every time i go grocery shopping, i find myself keeping an eye out for her, and if she's working the cash register, i try to make it a point to check out in her aisle.  of course, i always hope that some moment of suaveness will take hold, and i'll be able to chat her up and impress her.  needless to say though, being introverted and such, the most i've been able to do beside normal checkout pleasantries was make eye contact and exchange smiles.  on a recent  shopping trip though, i was checking out in a normal line, and she was supervising the self-checkout.  as i was getting rung up, she left her station and came over to bag my groceries, which struck me as odd (normally they just leave it to the bag boys), but i wasn't complaining.  in my infatuated and likely over-analytical mindset, i thought she might be showing some interest.

that was a couple weeks ago.  fast forward to present, i've been single for a while, but feeling a yearn for female companionship, have gotten active on ok cupid again recently.  i've had less success than usual at getting replies from girls--the response ratio is never great on dating sites, but it's been downright abysmal this time around (none).  

that is, up until the other night, when all of the sudden, something must have clicked and several ladies actually messaged *me*.  i found myself chatting and flirting, and seemed to be hitting it off with them.  i had a couple tumblers of whiskey while i typed, was having fun talking to the girls, and with the sudden reversal of attention, i was feeling pretty good about myself.

that's when i happened to see her in the ""you may also like"" sidebar.  yup, grocery girl.

i see that not only does grocery girl have an account, but she's single, and has a great match rating with me (96%).  ""holy shit,"" i thought, ""this is the perfect opportunity for me to finally talk to her and get this awkward introduction stuff out of the way.""  looking at her pictures, she was even more beautiful when she didn't have to wear her work uniform, and her personality, as okc indicated, seemed to really jive with mine.

as i was looking at her profile, she came online, possibly because she got an email saying someone was checking her out.  i figured if that was the case, i very well couldn't sign off without sending her a message. so, in my whiskey infused and confidently flirty state, i typed out a simple message, saying that i recognized her from the store and had wanted to talk to her but never felt like the opportunity was right.  but now here i was saying hi, and all that.  i spent a little time editing and rewriting sentences so that it could come off as (hopefully) flirty, but not overbearing.  eventually, i thought had a good enough first message, and clicked ""send.""

i'd hoped to wake up in the morning and find a message from her saying something along the lines of how she'd noticed me too, and wanted to get to know me, and blah blah blah.  when i checked my email the next morning though, there was no new message from her.  there was a message that she'd visited my profile though, late in the evening.  so she'd definitely gotten my message, looked to see who it was from, and that was that.

thinking about it in hindsight, i realize that girls may not feel the same way about hearing guys notice them in public, repeatedly.  even though we may have a good compatibility rating, and there *may* have been some mutual attraction beforehand, i fear i may have come off as stalkerish and creepy.  i haven't been grocery shopping since sending that message, but i haven't quite figured out how to handle the awkwardness that will ensue when i do.","had my eye on a checkout girl for a while, randomly stumbled on her profile on ok cupid, sent her a message and may have come off as a creeper."
722,"i was just trolling around facebook when i remembered that i had to tell this girl that me and my friend found her lost ruler.

we chatted for a while...

723,"this was years ago when i was in high school. i always liked origami, but it took me a while to come up with the idea of finally making the famous paper crane. so during a useless computer class (that was sooo easy, and we could do other stuff if we're done with our work), i looked up the instructions and memorized them.

when i had access to paper during the next class (i think this was a boring math class i read books in and still aced), i decided to make it. it took about half the class to figure it out and remember all the instructions. (it turns out that i forgot one of the last steps for years, so my crane's wings were triangles, and the head/neck and tail were larger.)

i took it with me for the rest of the day; i admired the little guy.

then came a class near the end of the day with an interesting reading teacher. i usually liked him...until this day. while we were writing something in our notebooks or journals or whatever, he walks by our desks nonchalantly. when he got to mine, he grabbed and crumbled my poor little creation--my first crane. he had a scowl on his face as he repeatedly crumbled it and threw it away.

since we were supposed to be quiet, i decided to say nothing. my only guess as to why he did such a thing was that he lacked the common knowledge that origami does not mean ""paper plane."" at the end of that school year, most of my nice teachers got a paper crane from me (and also a little piece of coal during christmastime =p). but not him. i even gave one to the student teacher that substituted for him in the last half of the year.",- a reading teacher destroyed my poor paper crane.
724,"so i'm at work today and my family kept texting me, but because of company rules, i was hesitant to check my messages.  i really had to take a piss so i decided i would check them while i relieved myself.  

i was standing at the urinal, phone in my left hand, trying to type out replies before i finished up.  i got about 3 seconds into my stream when the vice president of the company comes into the bathroom and stands at the urinal next to me.  before he even got there, i was attempting to power off the screen(out of habit) and put my phone back into my pocket...  

it slipped... 

the amount of terror i felt made me react like a damn ninja.  i tried to snatch my phone out of the air only to bump it and have it land directly in the urinal...  i pissed on it for a second before i realized that it made a shit ton of noise and there was no way i could hide the fact that i just dropped something into the urinal...  i pinched off my stream, grabbed my urine soaked iphone, finished pissing and proceeded to rinse it off as much as i could(luckily i have a nice case so it wasn't water/urine damaged).  

i think our vp felt bad about it because he didn't say a word to me, even after seeing me take it to the sink and rinse it off..",i needed to check my phone at work and they don't allow us to do that.  i dropped my iphone into the toilet at work and pissed on it because i was afraid our vp would get mad at me for having my phone out.
725,"i am 26(f) and my boss is probably like 50(m). he is a scary guy, he is paid to be scary. i work as a paralegal in a medium sized firm. in all seriousness, this guy is trained in interrogation and was a cop for 25+ years before he got into this business. he is the person who is paid to make you trip up and cry your eyes out under examination.


anyway, he's never been too mean to me but i am usually really diligent around him. whenever i do something wrong i am always apologetic and i tell him that i will strive for perfection in the future.
today though...today was different.


the important backstory here is that i once dreamed of being a lawyer. i got my honors in poli sci, wrote my lsat a few times and didn't do as well as i needed to. i decided to get my paralegal license and try my best to bulk up my experience over the next few years in hopes of improving my chances of getting in to lawschool. two years ago when i started this i didn't mind so much, but the reality of filing, briefing, and doing absolutely nothing with my degree (not to mention making less than when i was a waitress) has started to take it's toll on my mentality. normally i am an incredibly positive and enthusiastic person. i have been doing my level best to stay happy and see the light at the end of the  tunnel here, but some days it just feels like i am absolutely wasting away in a dead end job where i am learning nothing and becoming more complacent by the hour.


anyway, to the story. normally i am a pretty calm person and i can deal with my boss's outbursts. also, usually they aren't directed at me so it's not so bad. keep in mind, we are talking about a guy that needs a reminder for his reminders, flips out of a post it note falls off his computer, and regularly tells me he needs something ""an hour ago"".


this morning when i came in he said he needed to speak with me and told me to shut his door. he's never really done this before and i started getting a bit nervous. i have had past issues with abusive partners cornering me and harming me so i can see why i started to shake a bit. still, i take my job really seriously and i try to compose myself. he points out that i got one of the attachments wrong on a letter we were sending out. he starts shaking the page at me and telling me that this is completely unacceptable, he expects more from me, he feels like he can't trust me, he wants to know what going on.


all i can think of is i make less than people working at mcdonald's and i feel like my entire life is a joke because of this job but i can't quit because it's also the only thing i have helping me hold on to some semblance of hope that one day i will be able to pursue this dream of mine and that i didn't completely waste my time on my education. he keeps pressuring me to tell him what it really is that's been causing me to slip up (it took me too long to get some searches done on monday which really irritated him as well). 


anyway, the only thing i can think of to say is that it is just a 'personal issue' and that i realize it is unacceptable. instead, the truth of all of the depression and anxiety and disappointment in myself bubbled up at that moment. he's a trained interrogator and it is fucking hard to lie to him. even though my words were a lie, my face told the complete truth. i turned into a crying, shaking, hyperventilating wreck. his face lost all colour. i am apologizing for crying, he is staring at me blankly. i said ""i'm so sorry"" he laughs and says ""i do it all the time."" wtf? 


it took me another 5 minutes sitting there to try and compose myself just so i could leave his office without being a splotchy mess.  i had to go to the washroom and cry it out some more in there afterwards because i was extra upset at myself for having the meltdown in the first place. this is like the most serious guy on the planet, he relies on me to keep my cool and do a good job under pressure, he deals with situations where people stand to win or lose millions of dollars, he is never intimidated, and all i showed him was that i melt like butter in a frying pan under confrontation.","cried in front of my serious lawyer boss for no real reason, lost a lot of respect for myself professionally, probably not cut out for this business."
726,"now before we begin, it's worth giving a grounding on my flatmate as this tale of woe isn't nearly as awkward without it. this flatmate (22) had never used a microwave before coming to uni, and subsequently tried to make toast in it by moistening the bread and whacking on full power for 20 minutes. he then included a fork the mix and has since made toast on the hob (no pans). he enjoys eating bulbs of raw garlic and watching tacky sci-fi from his birds nest atop the fridge. just the other day he was gracious enough to give me a slice of nice hot, buttery toast... no of course, he doesn't like butter and had in fact given me a generous helping of colman's mustard. 

i don't like mustard at all. 

if you met the chap you'd never suspect a thing wrong in the world, but in short he is just... odd. i've never known him to show an interest in women, or men for that matter of any kind and i theorise he is asexual and is simply working on breeding a twin. anyway - the story.

i was late for a train. the train lead directly to a plane which i was cutting fine anyway. less than preferable really. travelling light, i'd cunningly tucked my keys in the deepest, darkest crevice of my bag i could find - frankly gollum wouldn't bother hunting in there. this became a problem as i walked out of my block and felt a cylindrical object in my coat pocket. my girlfriends turbo-charged vibrator. in a baffled panic the ensuing scenarios ran through my mind should i fail to deal with this situation; 

1) i'd rock up to security at the airport and have to openly give a strange man a recently used vibrator. nope.

2) i'd rock up to security to try and smuggle what is basically an armoured dildo (armourdildo?) through a system built to stop unwanted forks. i would then be asked to produce my dildo, and possibly sized... i would then of course miss my flight and have to explain to my girlfriend why she could no longer accurately call me robocock.

only one thing for it really, i had hide it somewhere that no one would find. with a fraction of a second to spare i caught the door just before the magnetic lock sealed and hastily rammed aforementioned dildo into our letterbox. no one ever checks there... i think... truth be told i don't actually know...

i return home the following evening to find neat piles of mail on the table, and yes, armourdildo glistening triumphantly in the moonlight. excellent.

i get a cup of tea and settle down on the sofa and begin skyping my girlfriend... who i couldn't not tell about this story which utterly awkwarded her out... naturally. my flatmate then walks in and we embark on a pleasant conversation regarding what was in the mail, (no mention of armourdidlo) and my trip. bearing in mind my girlfriend was still in skype, using ""nice vibe about it"" and ""went by like some kind of bullet"" were probably not the most appropriate conversation fillers... but the situation was made better by my flatmate simply not knowing what the mysterious object was. only when later explaining did the shit hit the fan... still glad i didn't tell him it was in need of a good wipe...","hid girlfriends vibrator in letterbox, found by flatmate who just didn't know what it was."
727,"today, my school started at 10.55, so i got to sleep until 9.15. it felt like heaven. when i was ready, i took the 10 o' clock bus, so i would be in school around 10.40. my bus ride takes around 36 minutes.

five minutes into the bus ride. i notice my nose is a little bit runny. this is normal and happens to many people when they go from somewhere cold (outside) to somewhere warm (the bus). it felt annoying, as something runs down your nose. i had to wipe it on my coat sleeve. now it was all normal again. then, i felt it was running again. it started to drip from my nose. i had no idea what was going on. when i was texting on my phone it hit me. the drops were red.

""perfect"", i thought. now i'm sitting in a bus with a nosebleed. paper is nowhere to be seen and it drips all the time. my coat sleeve was now substituting for paper, as i couldn't let the blood drip on the bus floor or seat. after a little while, i remember the first aid for nosebleed. i leaned forward, and pressed with my fingers on my nose, a little bit under the nose bone. now the nosebleed was in control. after ca. 10 minutes, the blood in my nose was dry enough so i didn't have to keep pressure on it.

now the situation was under control, and time was for aftermath. i see a few drops hit the bus seat, but i didn't care about that then anymore, as the stain was visible only if you looked closely. my right hand had a little blood on it. my right sleeve on my coat had quite much blood on it. the best thing is that my coat is black and white. nice, mom will be happy to know.

when my stop came, i went straight to school. then i rushed up the stairs to the floor where my first class for today would be. i went to the toilet and looked in the mirror. i had a big, dried drop of blood on the tip of my nose. no wonder people stared at me. after washing everything off, i texted my cousin about the situation. she laughed her ass off. after that i also noticed that i had blood stains on my jeans. my mom will be *very* happy. i'm now sitting in school. i have a day to half past three. yay.","nosebleed in a bus is messy, especially if you haven't got any paper.**"
728,"ok.. i just need to rant a little, everyone. i need to provide some backstory before i can get into my fuck up of the day. 

so i have this weird thing about urinating in sinks. i'm 26, male, and have been peeing in sinks for at least 10 years, even if there is a perfectly fine toilet sitting next to it. i've peed in friend's bathroom sinks, strangers kitchen sinks, my girlfriend's parent's bathroom sink, public sinks (bars), and countless times in my own sink. all over the place. you get the idea. when i'm done i really don't clean the sink up excessively well- i'll generally run hot water and splash it all over to get all the pee down the drain. i couldn't tell you why i do this. i know it's disgusting, an outright selfish and abominable thing to do to the poor people who use the sink after me, unwitting to the fact that i've urinated down it. i know there's a lot wrong with me mentally, this is just one of the lovely little things that i do and honestly it's not the worst. 

on to tonight's news. i moved back to my parent's apartment sort of recently (i am unemployed and broke) and my 28 y.o. sister is still living here as well. i was in the kitchen around 11:30pm making some challah bread toast. i only had a dim light on so i could see what i was doing. my parents were in their room asleep and my sister was in her room with the door closed. while i was waiting for my toast to finish i went up to the kitchen sink, stood on my tip-toes and pulled my pecker out to pee. usually when i pee in the kitchen at night i'll check behind me to see if the light has changed down the hall way: that means that someone is out of their room and possibly coming my way. i guess i wasn't careful enough this time and my sister walked behind me into the kitchen while i had my pecker out and streaming into the sink. i heard her coming in at the last second and was able to stop midstream, and flip my shirt over my penis to hide it. she came right over to the sink and i faked rinsing out a already very clean looking bowl that was in there. she dropped off a mug at the side of the sink next to me and walked away, wordless. we usually don't talk at all, so this is normal behavior. i don't *think* she saw what i was doing as my back was to her and the room was dark, but she must have known something was up by my sudden rushed motions when she came in. 

i know it would be a good thing for me and everyone my behavior effects if i was outed tonight, but i'm still so afraid that i may have been. she internalizes a lot and she's rather non-confrontational so i don't think she would say anything to me about it if she did indeed catch me in the act. i would guess that she would probably talk to my mom about it and have her talk to me. because that's just what she does. meh.

anyway.. thanks for hearing me out, everyone. i've never told anyone about this before now.",i peed in the kitchen sink when i thought i was alone and my sister may have caught me in the act.
729,"i had been having diarreah for the better part of the morning (thanks cheap liquor and taco bell). so when i got out of the shower this morning i like to dry my dirty bits by standing in front of a fan.  while doing this i had the urge to fart...i violently shit into the fan.  it was awful, the poop got sprayed into a good 6 foot radius all over my bedroom. just finished the clean up and i'm currently basking in a mixture of shame and glory.",never trust a fart.
730,"this happened like three weeks ago so bear with me. i was in my drivers ed car(insurance reduction mothafucka) so were driving slow through a construction area and i see a few cops searching a car. and these are the unmarked car black suit kinda cops, so they're rummaging through the car and i think to yell as we pass ""the fucker is hauling meth"". instantly after i yell this one of the cops looks up at me. guess the fuck what, its the sheriff who's friends with both of my parents. so i get home and get the full shitstorm of rage for two hours. the only irony of this whole thing is they did actually find drugs in the car.","yelled at cop searching a car, he knows my parents and i heard their shit for two hours"
731,"decided to go to the bar tonight and little did i know my mom was there. i somewhat recognized her and gave her a molly (i had taken one as well.) well i get pretty wasted and i was faded from the molly and started chatting up my mom. turns out, i decide to leave the bar with my mom. we go back to my (our) place and have sex.",; hooked up with mom.
732,"so this actually happened about 10 years ago when i was in college. some friends and i were eating lunch in the cafeteria. we joke around a lot and all have odd senses or humor. anyway, at the next table, a group students were just sitting down. one of them was a little person. 

i don't know why i did it, i'm not normally a prejudiced jackhole. i was picked on as a kid and i know how it hurts to be made fun of. but nonetheless, on an impulse born of pure dickheadedness, i leaned in and quietly said to my friend sitting across from me, ""hey, check out the midget over there.""

her back was to this little person and her friends. when my friend heard ""over there"" it didn't occur to her that it could possibly mean ""directly fucking behind you"" cause she loudly and enthusiastically turned around exclaiming, ""ooh! a midget! where?!""

the little person looked over in shock. her friends looked at us like we were scum (accurate). my friend turned back facing me and died inside at what she had just done. we have never spoken of this incident since.",i was seized by a moment of temporary douche-sanity.
733,"my mother teaches kindergarten, and i stopped by her class on the way to my own school to bring her some shit she needed for the day.

she introduced me to her loud-ass kids. ""this is my daughter, lydia, blah blah blah. she's a big college kid."" they were all in awe. i felt kinda like a rockstar.

afterwards, a boy ran up to me, holding a chair like a shield. i thought he wanted to tell me something, but he just kept running. that's when the little bastard drove his chair upward, into my unsuspecting crotch.

all the wind left my body and i fell to the ground, holding myself. i flopped on the floor like a fish. mom pulled the brat aside while i, embarrassed and hurting, limped into the hallway, where i plopped down on a bench. i sat there, listening to my mom chew the kid out inside. i couldn't hear what she said, but the whole situation was pretty humiliating. i occasionally heard him cry ""but she's a girl!"" i guess he thought it wouldn't hurt because i'm a lady. i was sorry to prove him wrong.

a few minutes later, the boy came into the hall. my mom had forced him to give me a reluctant apology. i was even more pissed off now. ""you’re supposed to say 'it's okay.'"" he said. ""fuck you, asshole!"" my mouth shrieked on its own. the whole hall turned to look at me like a monster. if only they knew my story, they'd say the very same thing! i just waddled out the door and drove off to class. now i never want to show my face in that classroom again.

apparently, later that day, the boy asked my mom what ""fuck"" and ""asshole"" meant. he also asked if i was a boy. he also had to sit out recess for his vicious attack.",children are assholes. fuck 'em.
734,"to complete the trifecta of disaster that has befallen me this past month, i got an eviction notice. 

the day after finals ended, the management company that owns my apartment came around that morning to change the batteries in the smoke detectors in all the apartments. they're supposed to give 24 hours notice before entering the apartments but are pretty bad about it--sometimes they only put a notice up the morning they start maintenance. 

anyway, it was about 9 am and my boyfriend and i had slept through the alarm we had mistakenly left set, which had been going off for about two hours at that point. we were woken up by someone pounding on the door. he bolted out of bed and asked who it was. some guy answered and said he was there to change the batteries in the smoke detector. 

here's the problem: we had just gotten done with an insane round of finals, and had spent the past three weeks or so writing papers and studying and doing paperwork, with little time for anything else. needless to say, we'd been a bit lax with cleaning and our apartment was littered with dirty coffee mugs, plates, pizza boxes, papers, various other detritus, and about a month's worth of dirty laundry. 

bf asked the guy if he could come back in a few minutes. he said he had to do all the apartments in order, but that he would wait. it ended up taking twenty minutes for us to get everything into garbage bags and hampers and hidden away. we finally let the guy in, it takes about thirty seconds to change the battery, and then he's gone. 

cut to ten minutes later. somebody pound on the door and screams ""management! i need to talk to you!"" obviously we have no choice but to open the door. let it be known that this company owns half the property in town, most of the student housing, and is pretty spectacularly unreasonable. the bitch from the management office was standing there, and wanted to know what had happened with the smoke detector thing, talking down to us, generally being bitchy and unreasonable, and going on about how we should be ""concerned for our own safety"", apparent fire hazards, and other bullshit, and that due to our history (we were a few days late on rent payment this semester) and the state of our apartment (at that point it was down to three laundry baskets in the living room) they would have to evict us. we have four days (this happened yesterday) to get this place in a ""rentable"" condition since they'll never let us re-sign, or we're out. 

the problem isn't that the place is dirty, it's that two people are living in a place meant for one person, and that we have pretty much all we own in this apartment. with one closet.

looks like i'll be homeless on christmas eve. 

 

edit: i say ""bitch from the management office"" because she's been trying to find a reason to have us kicked out for about three months now. 

edit (ii): got eviction notice in mail yesterday and had to sign for it. definitely fucked.","didn't clean my apartment for about a month prior to finals, got pretty bad. unexpected wake-up call from the management the morning after finals ended to do maintenance, place was chaos. got eviction notice and will be out on my ass if i don't get this place spotless in four days."
735,"this just happened and i need to get it out of my system. sadly, shit is not something i tend to talk with my friends and i do not feel very proud of it.

i had a huge double hamburger with french fries and a beer for dinner (screw you stomach! i'm on winter break), pretty good stuff. but eating that much made me want to shit really bad (it's a 'thing', i always shit after eating a lot for dinner), so, like any other normal day i just went to the bathroom. all looks good, nothing out of the ordinary, i'm alone at home, i have tons of toilet paper and not a worry in the world.

all went pretty well, wasn't the best shit i had in my life, but i gotta tell you, i still feel refreshed from it.

i finish my business, clean myself and when i flush the toilet the water pressure is quite low for some reason and doesn't take all the load. rather, it just makes it dance all over the place for a while... i wait the tank to fill and try again. most of the shit leaves, but there's this one motherfucker who, somehow, got stuck *vertically* in the toilet. it looks like a shitty greek pillar holding the toilet together.

jesuschrist, i've flushed 5 times and the fucking piece of shit won't leave. i'm hoping water will make it softer so the next flush will make it go away... if not, god knows what i'm going to do, i don't have a pump (and i don't think it fit this particular kind of toilet), and getting close to shit makes me puke. ugh...

anyway, not the greatest story but i needed to share my first world problems with someone.",a shit pillar is stuck in my toilet in the weirdest way i can think of.
736,"backstory: so i am 15 and live with my parents and 5 yr old brother. my mom is very strict but my dad on the other hand is the chillest.

but anyway, i had just gotten some weed from my dealer( he lives right up the street so i can easily walk there.) so when i get home im sitting in my room looking at the reef when all of a sudden i hear my sliding glass door open downstairs which means my parents are home from picking up my bro from elementary school(his school is right behind my backyard fence so they just walk there and back to pick him up.) anyway the weed was still sitting on my desk so i quickly grabbed it and threw it into a ""land before time"" cassette case. i though this was a good spot, wrong! later when i got out of the shower i saw my light in my bedroom was on so i ran in to investigate only to find my whole box of old childhood memories was gone so i ran downstairs to find my brother watching ""land before time"" and the weed sitting on the counter with my parents sitting at the counter saying, ""i think we need to talk."" my mom then proceeded to take me to the police station to talk to an officer. so we got in the station and my mom went up to the counter and asked for a officer, five minutes passed and a cop came out and waved us back to one of those creepy-ass interrogation rooms.( meanwhile we were walking back i got at least a good 10 second stare from every cop in the damn office.) so we go back there and he spills the same mumbo jumbo i've been hearing for 7 years. and he ends off with ""weed is just like heroin so don't do it.""(wtf no bro... no) and so me and my madre left the police station and headed back to the abode were then the 2 hour yelling fest started which led to me being grounded for 2 months( no phone, no play station, and no leaving the house!) and the worst is i cant even go to our schools big basketball games which are huge where i live. i feel like i lost my moms trust and i don't know what to do so please help. its already been a day since i got caught.

737,"my girlfriend's cousin had just moved to the city and needed a place to live. he was trying to get away from his abusive parents and out of a bad life to get a fresh start. my gf said it would be ok for him to stay with us until he could get onto his feet.

he lived with us for about two months, in that time he got a job he was paying us rent, covered his own food and bills, found a girlfriend for himself and was really getting his life together. 

everything was good until i came home from work. the front door to our apartment was unlock and open slightly which as odd. we stepped into the apartment and there were a bunch of shoes that we didn't recognize. i called out to see if anyone was there and there was no response so i walked into my living room and noticed that we had been robbed.

they had stolen between $5000.000 to $10000.00 worth of stuff. we immediately called the police. in the 4 hours it took for them to show up we searched the house trying to take account of everything they had taken. we quickly discovered a bag in the middle of the room that was filled with needles, there was a pop can filled with cigarette ash and butts (we don't smoke). as mentioned before they had left behind pairs of shoes (but don't take any of our shoes). mostly they just stole electronics, movies, video games, and small things.

we tried to get a hold of my gf cousin to make sure he was ok. we could not get a hold of him on his cell phone, when we called we got a message it had been disconnected. we checked the voice mail on hour home phone and found a voice mail form his dad letting him know that he had bought him a bus ticket home for that day. we quickly called his work and found out that he had skipped his last shift. at this point we were starting to believe that he had been the one to rob us.

we decided to go onto his facebook, we looked through the friends that he had in the city, sure enough some of the shoes that were left behind matched the shoes that his friends were wearing in the photos. the bag left even match one his female friend had carried around. when the police finally showed up we gave point out all the strange things left behind in our apartment, we showed them the photo we found on face book. i gave them the serial numbers to my electronics, and told them what we think had happened.

 

edit* correcting ""girlfriend's cousin""","- my girlfriend's cousin was staying with us, one day he left the province without a word. that same day we were robbed. the robbers left behind shoes, pop cans, smokes, a bags, and needles. we were able to make some the stuff left behind to some of his friends"

i had just gotten off a 9 hour shift and i was famished. i knew there was nothing quick and easy to eat at home so i stopped by the store. i picked up a bag of chicken patty's that i had never had before. it wasn't anything fancy, it advertised the chicken on a sandwich on the bag. standard stuff. i figured i would head home, pop one in the microwave and munch while wasting my life away on reddit. 
i do just that. 
a few bites in i found a weirdly textured piece but figured it was just a tendon. mind you, i was dipping the patty pieces in ranch, so i wasn't tasting much other than ranch.

fast forward to about 12 hours later, that sandwich and subway were the only things i ate today. i'm working on transferring apps/data from my uncle's (nigerian, came into town for a party) galaxy tab 10.1, to his new galaxy tab 2 10.1. all of a sudden, his strong urge to take a shit hits me (kinda gassy before then, but didn't think it was anything) and i get up and run to the nearest bathroom. 

little did i know the repairman had been working on stuff in the bathroom, so the toilet was messy and dirty as fuck.  although i knew that i had to take a massive, urgent shit, i valued my health too much so i booked it to the upstairs bathroom. mind you, shit was about ready to explode out of my asshole by now, so it took sheer willpower to hold it in.

made it to the upstairs bathroom, and by the time i locked the door, i could feel the wet shit about to explode. as soon as i took off my pants, the floodgates of my asshole opened up, and let loose a torrent of diarrhea on my toilet. thankfully most of it made it into the bowl.

747,"this actually happened  about 6 years ago but it is the epitome of my stupidity. 

so, i was camping with a group of kids and adults from my church's scout group. we were near the snake river in idaho. we were going to be rafting the river and just having fun for a few days. well, the first day we got to camp we had nothing to do in the afternoon, so we decided to make a rope swing. now, at the time, all the kids were 16-18 and the adults were in their 30s. we had just enough common sense to make a swing on a large branch and not some spindly thing. the branch we picked had a diameter of about 12 inches so we figured it could hold our weight. after finding this branch we tied a hammer to our rope and threw that over. success! our make shift swing was in order. we tested this out and it work perfectly. 

over the next few days we grew bored with simple swinging and progressed to more risky activities with the swing. we were full on sprinting to get as high as possible, putting multiple people on it, etc. you know, the kind of stuff teenagers are want to do. now, throughout this time the branch had held its own admirably well (we didn't pick a slouch of a branch after all). if this branch was a bro, he was the ultimate bro. always there for us and never slacking when we needed him. the best kind of bro. we had no reason to doubt the bro-branch when we attempted our final stunt. 

at this point, we were completely bored with simple swinging so we decided to haul people to the top like a pulley. i, myself, wasn't dumb enough to try this at first. that branch was 30 feet off the ground so there was no way i was going up there without having someone test it out. the guy who volunteered was about 220 and really built. a state champion wrestler so he was big enough and brave enough to assuage all our doubts about the sturdiness of the branch. he went up, touched the branch and chilled up there for a few minutes. no problems.

now that i had seen this system in action i was confidant enough to try it myself. i weighed only 125 so i had no reason to doubt that the branch would give out on me. 

oh, how wrong i was. 

i began my ascent and was steadily raised to the top. 10 feet up. 20 feet. 25 feet. nothing was going to stop  me from hanging at the top of this motherfucking tree. i was inches away from my goal. 30 feet. i did it! i had reached the branch! 

**crack**

oh. fuck. 

right as i touched it, the branch just snapped off and i plummeted to the ground. 30 feet, straight down. 

now, take a moment to imagine a bunch of 18 year old kids sitting under a large branch that is falling. the logical thing to do is to scatter and get out from the impact zone, right? well, everyone but one kid thought so. the wrestler. he had the noble thought to try and catch me and try and avoid getting a faceful of branch. well, he didn't exactly succeed. 

i fell straight down and hot the ground as if i were just standing up. all the impact shock went up my knees and spine. the wrestler missed me and instead caught the branch. *kind of.* he ended up getting hit on the head by this thing and got a concussion. 

now i was in immense pain and was writhing on the ground. everyone had recovered from the shock and was attempting to figure out if anyone was hurt. my first thought was to have someone help me up so i could try and walk this off. as i attempted this, the adults in the camp finally had gotten to the disaster site and were pushing me back down telling me not to move. all i could do was lie there and attempt to assess the damage. i was down. wrestler was down. bro-branch was down. this wasn't good. 

after a few minutes i convinced the adults to let me get up and try walking this off. i was lucky enough that i was able to walk and didn't seem to have a broken ankle or leg. but by god, was i in pain! i hobbled off to a chair by the fire so i could get off my feet for a bit. 

i have to say, the fact that everyone at camp was completely sober is what sets this apart. we weren't being stupid drunks, we were just stupid kids. 

now, i was in pain but felt well enough that we weren't rushing to the hospital to get me examined. i was just going to tough it out until we left. *two days later.* luckily, most of the pain had subsided and i was just extremely sore, although, i tried to avoid walking as much as possible.  

the ride home two days later wasn't much better, though. the rode was bumpy as fuck and every jostle was sending new pain up my spine. and to make matters worse, every time i would sneeze it would be like i was having a seizure. completely uncontrollable spasms for every sneeze. and i suffer from a photic sneeze reflex (commonly called sun sneezes) so i tend to sneeze quite often in bright light. 

we finally made it home and i walked in to greet my parents. my mom was exuberant to see me but all i could manage was a weak smile as i stammered ""mom, i need to go to the hospital."" to her credit, she took that reasonably well and i told her the whole story. she just shook her head saying how dumb i was and we left to get me checked out.

fast forward a couple days later after i have had x-rays and cat scans done. turns out i had 3 compression fractures in my lower vertebrae. and the best part of the whole diagnosis? there was nothing to be done. i had to deal with it and simply take it easy while the vertebrae un-compressed as much as possible. at least most of the pain had subsided.

now, nearly 6 years later, they are still slightly compressed, albeit better than they were when this happened. i still get pain back there from time to time as well and can't really be too aggressive on it.",used a rope to get hauled 30 feet up a tree when the branch broke. i fell and fractured my back. it's still fractured 6 years later. i fucked up.
748,"i had just finished making some late-night munchies in the form of pot-stickers (the idea sounded brilliant considering previous activities) and reached across the stove to reach a pack of soy sauce i put across the way. 

i reached across the stove. with a lack of a shirt. and according to gabriel iglesias, i'm somewhere between husky and fluffy. either way, the protective covering for the abs did its job...at the cost of me now holding an ice pack up to my gut.","munchies had, hot stove + belly = bad"
749,"i was sitting at my desk earlier this afternoon, redditing away, with a nice, tall glass of grapefruit juice on the little pullout-table thing that my desk has. it was sitting on my right side. 

now, for this to make sense, you need to know that my room is pretty small, and when i am sitting at my desk, my back is usually against the edge of my bed. a couple feet to my right, also against the edge of my bed on the floor, is my netbook.

now, i am sure that you can all see where this is going by now, but as i absentmindedly reached for my glass of juice without looking at it (hey, it was an interesting post, ok?) i instead knocked it over with my wrist, and it spilled all over my floor, and my netbook. 

i quickly realized what had happened and picked up the glass, but the damage was done. i picked up the netbook and immediately wiped off the bottom (it was sitting with the bottom up for whatever reason), set it aside, and cleaned up the rest of the spill. 

after that was done, i looked up a youtube video on how to tear down the netbook and did so, wiping what i could and blowing off the rest with canned air. once i was sure it was dry, i screwed it all back together, and in a very stressful moment, turned it on. luckily, it works fine again, no harm done. 

**","** knocked over grapefruit juice onto netbook, had to completely tear it down and dry it, works fine now."
750,"i seriously kinda fucked up today, even tough it was freaking hilarious.

so my friend is taking a graphic design class which he absolutely hates and asked me to create a banner for him. he jokingly said, ""do anything you want with it, even midget porn. just make sure it looks good"". i was bored that day and kinda good at graphic design, so that's what i did. however, i really didn't really take it seriously and tried to recreate the world's worst banner in photoshop and all of that in less than 3 minutes.

i succeeded, and sent him the link to the picture. however, i didn't tell him that it was a joke. as it turns out, he didn't even look at the banner and just immediately saved the link. so today in class he was asked to present his creation and my beautiful piece of work with midget porn, comic sans, and rainbow colors was presented to his 42-year old graphic design teacher and the rest of the class.

yep, he's pissed.

751,"so this happened twenty minutes ago. i am emotionally and physically wounded.

my dad headed out for a lunch with some friends, and my mom tells me she's going for a manicure. i say goodbye and watch her pull out of the driveway, smiling from ear-to-ear.

the instant i shut the front door, i b-line for their washroom (detachable shower head). i have been living away for grad school, the house i'm living in has an attached shower head, so needless to say i was excited. i throw my clothes on the floor, get the temperature just right and hop in.

in my overwhelming excitement, i forget to lock the bathroom door. not that it mattered, no one was home . . .

i'm enjoying the jet setting and i'm about to orgasm when i hear, ""my-name, i forgot to ask if you wanna . . .  **oh dear!!**"" my mom had double-backed to ask if i wanted to join her manicure session, but instead she walked in on me holding the shower head to my clit.

she screams and turns around awkwardly while i panic; instead of turning the shower off, i turn it to the hottest setting there is.

**""my fucking vagina!!!""** echoes from the shower, down the hall, around the corner and into my mother's already damaged head.

so, here i am, holding a freezing cold wash cloth on my clit while dying from embarrassment waiting for my mother to get home from her manicure. 

 

**update**: i didn't get a chance to talk to my mom until this afternoon. i decided to be mature and ""confront"" her about what she saw. i basically started with ""i'm sorry you had to see that but hey, shit happens"". my mom laughed and said ""don't worry about it, let's just forget it"". i am back at my grad-school house, so hopefully with a little distance, my mother will not be consistently reminded of this ordeal via my presence.","masturbating with shower head, mom walks in, i turn the knob to hot instead of off and burn my vagina."
752,"**this is a real long story, so bear with me. names have been changed. this all happened 2 nights ago on halloween.**

like many other college students around the country, i dressed up and went to this halloween party that my college was throwing. it was fun and all seeing my friends in their costumes and stuff, but it was *super* boring there cause, you know, it was being thrown by the school. me and four of my friends decide to ditch it and go to another party. one of the girls with us, suzy, was obviously into me, making a point to sit next to me while we waited for the others, laughing at my dumb jokes, all that. i'm feeling pretty good about myself. so me and 12 other people (along with my 4 friends) piled into the bed of a pickup truck (the driver was also going to the party) and take to the roads.

that was **fuck-up #1**. 

i didn't know it at the time, but driver had already been drinking. so he was going at least 50 miles an hour down these roads, and several times the bed of the truck scraped against the road cause the 12 of us were weighing it down. at one point he took a turn way too fast, and the truck almost tipped over. eventually we got to the party house and i'm thanking god almighty for letting me get there alive. 

here we are at the house (which i had never been to) and it's pretty packed. you had to be pushy just get through the front door, let alone the kitchen where the drinks were being served. so me and suzy walked in after the rest of the group and grabbed a drink, and we're all just talking right now. pretty soon i'm dancing with her and having a good time.

i'm gonna pause the story for a second. suzy wasn't really a friend - more like an acquaintance. my other friends that i know well know suzy, but i've only hung out with her twice before (with a bunch of other people). so because of this, i'm completely unaware of the fact that suzy loves to get *absolutely wasted*.

back to the story. suzy and i are dancing and having a great time. she's got real close to me and stuff, and she reached behind to put her hands on my chest and waist. then she wrapped her arms around my neck, and i just kissed her on the cheek. i knew i did something right cause she looks up at me and has this ear to ear grin on her face. so for the next 20 minutes or so we alternated between making out and dancing. she left for a bit at one point, and i just assume she's going to see other friends of hers. i stay where i am and talk with my other friends, too. suzy came back, and we return to making out and dancing.

at this point i've only had one drink, since i don't really like alcohol that much, but whatever, i'll have one just to have one. unbeknownst to me, suzy was not speaking with friends when she left. she was getting more and more drunk.

eventually we got a warning that the cops are about to show up, so me and my 3 other friends decided to head out and go back to the dorms. suzy takes me by the hand and we got outta there. but the moment she crosses the threshold from inside the house to outside she falls forward, running into another girl and nearly falling over.

so now it hits me that for the last 40 minutes i've been making out with a severely drunk girl while i've been totally sober. that was **fuck-up #2**.

i stood there in shock for a second. how was suzy *this* drunk? her speech wasn't slurred when we were talking in the house, she wasn't tipping over when we were dancing, nothing. i was amazed at how sober she had seemed while inside the house. so i was freaking out just a little. to anyone else, it looks like i was taking advantage of her.

before we started walking to the dorms, i did a sobriety check. i've only had my one drink, so i'm good. the other girl with us, avanti, was pretty sober, too. the two other guys (let's call them jake and randy) were kind of on the threshold of drunk, but still sober enough to walk and form somewhat coherent sentences. suzy wasn't able to do either of those things.

**fuck-up #3** was not thinking to call one of my other friends who wasn't at the party to come pick us up.

since we didn't have a ride back to the dorms we had to walk there, which was a task much easier said than done. randy and i were holding up suzy by the arms, and jake was just walking behind up being weird. and in the spirit of my terrible luck that night, we ended up taking the long way back, cause randy couldn't quite remember each turn and i was too busy trying to keep this girl from falling into the road.

so we hoofed it. several times suzy decides to just lay down on the sidewalk and yell ""carry me!"". people driving past eyeball us like crazy. one car actually pulled up to the curb and asked if we were okay and needed a ride. we politely declined because stranger danger, but i was seriously considering it at some points. whenever we get to a streetlight or road sign i had to forcibly pull her away from the obstacle because she wanted to run into it. 

now, just take a second and imagine how sketchy this all would look: three guys in ridiculous costumes walking around the streets of the city, holding a drunk girl who could barely stand up or talk. i'm surprised we weren't stopped by the two cop cars that drove past us during our trip. did i mention we're all underage, too?

but that wasn't the bad part. nope. the bad part is, during all the stumbling and drunken talk, jake mentions something about suzy's boyfriend. 

this was **fuck-up #4**, and it showed up in glorious fashion.

i was really, really pissed at jake now. he had ample time to mention that little tidbit to me, before we got to the party and during the party. a couple other people we knew did as well, but they didn't say anything either. so i was pretty pissed at them, and then also at myself for not asking suzy in the first place.

suzy drunkenly protests, however, saying that ""no, no, he told me i could go fuck whoever i wanted. fuck him. i can show you texts."" she handed me her phone to look at the text message conversation that supposedly cleared her of having an so. nothing in those message suggested that she had broken up with him.

so now i'm feeling pretty bad. after all, i just spent the last hour and a half dancing with this chick and making out with her, and it turns out she has a boyfriend. just great. 

after nearly 20 minutes of walking, we were within sight of the dorms. almost home free, but there's still a ways to go. i'm convinced that my left arm is going to be jacked the next day from holding this dead weight girl up. suzy wasn't on the chubby side or anything, but she kept on falling down and dragging her feet. god apparently decided to cut me a break right then, because a car pulled up and in it are more of my friends we all know. they had been having a late night snack down at this food court area and saw us on the street.

they did a u turn and pulled up next to us on the curb. suzy and i got in the rear passenger seats, while drunken randy popped open the trunk and hops in, even though he could've fit just fine next to me. jake also decided there's no more room and just smiles at us, saying that he'll walk the rest of the way himself. i wasn't worried about him at all, so we say whatever and haul ass out of there.

we drove up to the dorms and showed our ids to the security guard (thankfully suzy actually shut up for 5 seconds while we did this), and then pulled around to the rear entrances into the building so we could avoid the lobby area. i hopped out and helped suzy get out of the car without bashing her head in on the asphalt or another vehicle, while my other two friends (let's call them frankie and tyler) walk around to the lobby. randy and i help suzy up to her dorm room.

so we made it. we finally get to this girl's room. she's been talking about her ungodly desire to pee for the last 30 minutes, so we guide her towards the bathroom, sit her down on the toilet, and stand outside while she does her stuff. randy says that he's gotta go get his stuff from frankie's car, and i was stupid enough to let him go and leave me alone with suzy, too busy thinking about how crappy the night had been. that, of course, was **fuck-up #5**, but thankfully nothing came of it. 

i heard the toilet flush and i waited a few seconds before knocking on the bathroom door. suddenly there was an incredibly noisy *crash*, followed by a bunch of *tinks* and *thumps*. i opened the door and suzy's sitting in the bathtub with shampoo containers and shower shelves lying around her - she had stood up from the toilet and fallen over immediately. i helped her up and walked her to her bed, and all the while she's giggling like crazy. she invites me to the bed a few times (""nothing sexual,” she slurs, “just platonic"") but i refuse.

eventually randy comes back with frankie, tyler, and a couple others who agree to stay and make sure suzy doesn't kill herself by accident. glad to get a load off, i go to mcdonald's with frankie and tyler to get some food and clear my head of this shitty, shitty night.

**super","** i went to a party, made out with a girl, found out she has a boyfriend, walked her drunk ass home, felt real shitty about it and eventually scored a double cheeseburger at mickey d's."
753,"this morning i was getting dressed for work. took a shower, brushed my teeth. i started to wash my face when i notice my girlfriend left a bottle of what looks like face wash. i pick up the bottle, look at the directions: *for external use only. wet area and apply*. i was in a rush and out of face wash so i completely missed the vagina bit. washed my face with the stuff and went to work.

fast forward and i'm home playing gta v. girlfriend stops me and asks, ""what were you doing with this?""

""yeah, i noticed you left that for me.""

""for you?""

""yeah, i'm out of face wash, remember?""

she then bursts into tears of laughter. she falls over on the couch, her head on my lap. i paused. as i had my little revelation. she gets up and yells, ""you fucking dumbass! this isn't face wash!!"" my eyes wide, and my mouth gaping, i whisper ""no..."" in a defeated tone. she's on the floor by then, still in tears. she throws the bottle at my face, and says, ""summer's eve, fool! it's not face wash,"" she gasps for air. ""it's *pussy* wash!""",washed my face with a vagina care product.
754,"so, as it goes i needed a new laptop. the one i was using was very old and beaten to hell. i'm talking this thing had been dropped numerous times, charger fell apart along with the battery being a dud and the screen going out. all after getting those fixed i told a ""friend"" of mine that i needed a new one that i could actually carry around with me instead of constantly having to sit in one place and fuck around with the charging cord. 
well, as it is this friend gives me an hp of his that he had used for work only. he claimed that he cleaned off his stuff and it was in working order. he failed to tell me is that it wont boot up at all past a certain screen after the ""cleaning."" i'm saying i can turn it on and get it to a screen that tells me to hit f11 and then sends me to a point where i can recover files and after all that restart the computer and then it goes in a complete circle. this computer is basically as useless to me as the stationary laptop outside.",trusted a friend about a computer he obviously knew did not work.
755,"actually it did not happen today but some days ago. i was in the basement in our ""entertainment room"". we have a tv, stereo and some consoles there. i showed my 7 year old son my old music collection. i started with some 90s techno and he liked it. i then asked him: ""did you know that music can even scare you?"" he did not believe me so i started aphex twin - come to daddy. he sat in his seat and was getting smaller and smaller until he cried. i instantly stopped the music :-(",too lazy didn't write summary
756,"so this actually happened a few years ago while i was in high school, and it's gotten to be a pretty popular story passed on with my debate team.

at the time, i went to a catholic, all-boy school where many of the teachers were priests or monks. i was also the captain of the lincoln douglas (one-on-one) debate team and so i worked very closely with our coach, who was a monk. despite whatever you may think about monks, he was a pretty cool guy and was pretty easy to get along with so long as you didn't piss him off.

also at this time, i had been experiencing some computer trouble. for instance, google chrome, my default browser, was having trouble working when i wanted it to. it would also load many pages very slowly. it was pretty irritating.

a few months into my senior year, we had a debate tournament in a nearby city. it was a large tournament, and like many large tournaments it had posted its brackets, wins/losses, and reviews of debate rounds to a website designed specifically for debate tournaments. i had brought my computer with me to the tournament because i would usually read my speeches off of my computer, and i was tethering through my phone for internet because the school the tournament was in had a wifi password. so basically, i was the one of the few people on our team who had internet access.

naturally, while we wait between rounds in the school auditorium the coach wants to use my computer for a few minutes to check on the website postings. i see no problem with this, so i gave him my laptop. i already had chrome up and everything, so all he had to do was open a new tab and enter in the website url.

he sits at the computer for a few minutes while i play doodle jump a few rows away, and then says he's done and i can take the computer back. cool, i think, and go and get it from him. he closes it, and as i take it he says ""thank you thereverendjoseph, thank you"" almost in a malicious way. uhm, okay, cool. you're welcome? whatever. i sat back down in my seat and continued at doodle jump.

a few minutes later i decided to make some edits to my speeches based on some things i had overheard in other team discussions. i open up my laptop. there is a pdf open of the current debate brackets, but it isn't quite at the top of the screen. at the top of the screen, to my dismay, was a series of firefox tabs: ""slut takes it in from behind"", ""horny milf bangs teen"", etc., followed by ""debatepostings.com"" or whatever it was called. 

i had forgotten that, about a month or two prior, i had gotten pissed off at chrome while trying to find some decent porn that i had opted to use firefox instead. now, i'm not dumb, i use incognito windows, but since i used firefox i had just used a normal window for it, and had forgotten that i had firefox set to open up to the last closed window because i so rarely used the browser. when he went on my computer, he had opened firefox rather than just using chrome, and bam, porn.

while i was figuring all of this out, which took only about thirty seconds, i was too engaged in trying to figure out what the hell had happened to realize that the sound was on, and the videos were all *playing*, and my sound was on. i was in an auditorium full of 200+ kids, and i had moans coming from my computer. i slammed my computer shut as soon as i realized, and people in the rows around me were staring, understandably.

the monk and i stayed friends, and we talked every now and then, but he never quite trusted me with a computer in his presence. i assume he thought i was watching porn at the debate tournament, and he had just caught a glimpse of that. but yeah, i fucked up pretty hard.","i tried to be helpful, ended up showing a monk porn."
757,"so as part of my job at a restaurant, i have to clean the large glass doors at the entrance of the place. they get really nasty from all of the hands that push on the glass to open it, so they have to be sprayed down from time to time. pretty gross. 

anyways, it's time to clean the windows. i spray down the doors real good, then i reach backwards. huh, the door is back farther than i thought it was. i take another step backwards, still reaching backwards. my hand hits something. it's not a door, but my stupid brain doesn't realize it's not a door. 

as i keep reaching back at this ""door,"" i notice that some of my fellow workers are giving me horrified looks. i finally turn around to find that my hand has been pressing against some guy's junk for the past couple seconds. i slowly look up at him, seeing the most perplexed look on his face. i choke out an awkward sorry, look back down, hold the door open for him, and walk into the bathroom full of shame.","i tried to clean a door, but i groped a customer. repetitively."
758,"throw away because, you know...i shit myself. it literally happen around...13 mins ago(minus the typing). i wanted to take a picture of my brown stained jeans. but i realized i'm in public and the stench is invigorating...except in a negative way. anyways i was walking to the bus stop(driving test next week.) and waiting for the bus. i got on and i felt something wrong. kinda like a motion sickness kinda way. i reached my college and now i'm going to class. as i approached the door, i felt like i needed to fart. so i proceed to do so. but this one is a tough one. i mustard all my might and obliterated my boxers with shat. i froze, i'm 3 inches from the door way to my class. i feel the liquid shat drizzle down my boxers down to my right thigh. it felt lukewarm. the texture felt like the cross between water and dijon mustard. people looked at me. i not sure if they smell it. but oddly my new jeans was taking it quite well. i just washed it and using 2 cups of detergent and 5 sheets of softener sheets before shitting in it. so the glade smell is quite strong in this one. i slowly reversed my steps. luckily the bus came in just in time. i paid the fare. sat down on my shat. and waited. a lady sat near me, she started to question the smell. she said ""wow, it smells like clean clothes! is that you?"". i nodded. when the door open i quickly ran to my house, unlocked it. pants off. the smell was a mix of ass and a strong frebreeze hybrid glade. i stuffed it in the washer for 50 mins. never again i'm trusting my farts again.",trusting a fart. shat myself. lady loved the smell of ass.
759,"so, this didn't happen yesterday but in july. me and my lady have been together for 7 years today (but got married in july 20th), so i thought it'd be good time to share this story.

the night before the wedding me and my bestman went to our local small pub to have a couple of pints. (the pub and the wedding place are in the region we used to live in when we were younger.) we talked about the next day and how my life had come to this and so on, i even talked how i wasn't scared or anxious. we even saw some of my friends from another town (where me and mrs. live nowadays), so we had two more beers each. so when we got to bed it was like 3 am and we had to get up at 8. so not too much sleep for the night, and the next day would be a big one.

well, despite my lack of sleep the next day was perfect. fucking flawless. i was so goddamn scared at the altar before my soon-to-be-wife entered the main hall, but still it was marvelous. a friend performed a song by enya with her violin at the church and our wedding march (or is it hymeneal in the us?) was outro by m83, so i couldn't hold back the tears.

the party itself was also so great, even though i feared beforehand that i'd get too drunk at my own wedding. we partied till 4 am, and then everyone ordered cabs, including me, the wife and our siblings and cousins. since the place was at the countryside, we waited for our taxi for an hour. and during that time i drank the last bottle of champagne by myself and had fun with the remaining guests.

the taxi arrives, i hop in, and pass out immediately. i remember everything except the cab ride. when the taxi arrived to our hotel, nobody could wake me up, so my now-wife just stood there and laughed her pretty little ass of while our friends, four of them, carried me to our suite, the bride giggling behind us. or so i heard. they even tried to take off my suit, but eventually gave up and went to their own rooms.

midday. i wake up. i feel quite... moist, so to speak. i immediately knew what happened. thought: ""no fucking way, not here, not now. not again."" my bonjour-suit and the 3000 dollar bed were soaked. pee all over. this wasn't the first or the second time it had happened, but you know, this time it really ruined my morning. and morning wood. so there we were, lying in my piss, drinking champagne and eating grapes and enjoying the first day of our marriage.

760,"a few years ago, my school ran a foreign exchange program, some students from a fairly wealthy suburb of barcelona came to stay with families where i live for a week and we went over there later on in the year. the student i was paired with was a quiet kid who seemed really shy. (understandable in a foreign country where no-one speaks your first language.) 

a few days into the week, me and a friend were having an argument. i have a hard time remembering the cause but i know it was something very petty. so i'm walking to school with this terrified spanish kid, when my friend catches up with us. insults are swapped and this guy  is getting more and more nervous. this confrontation ends with the friend punching me. now, i am not a strong guy by any means, but i pretty much flip out and (in a move i'm pretty sure i got off assassins creed) i punch him in the gut so he doubles over, and kick him in the face. all the while, the exchange student is looking at me like i just shot his dog. we walk into school and all i can think to say to him is: ""sorry about that."" 

bottom line, he had to stay for the rest of the week in my house, (he looked upon me with the utmost terror.) and later on that year i had to go to his. his parents and teachers were the nicest people ever. but the looks they gave me when they thought i wasn't looking.","beat up a friend, traumatized a spanish exchange student."
761,"so saturday i was with my girlfriend and we were driving around the city searching for fun things to do. at dinner, she ordered steak, potatoes and gravy. after dinner she wanted a taste of my baby gravy so i willingly and happily let her have it. after the blowjob fest in the back of my car, the only way to clean up was to use these napkins i found in the back seat. i wiped us up and found a little empty bag of pork rinds that i stuck the cum wipes in. i was going to take the bag out to the trash when i got home but i forgot. the next day, i'm driving my grandparents to the deli so we can grab some brunch. on the way home, she finds the bag of pork rinds and starts digging through it picking up the napkins telling me to not put my ""snotty tissues"" into a potato chip bag. i corrected her and said it was a pork rind bag but i was not about to correct her about the snot actually being semen. she got some ""snot"" on her hand and wiped it on her dress. needless to say, i fucked up.

762,"so i was reading an [online comic](http://www.shadbase.com/propane-of-war/) [nsfwish](i was at a different part) a friend of mine sent me the other day. this comic has some funny parts and some other parts that are porn. i have been skipping the porn parts. 

now i have been keeping it open in a tab while i read it. i decided to browse reddit while i ate dinner with the comic still open. once i got done eating, a freshman asks me to install microsoft word for him. i agree and do it and it gets done. afterwords me and him were talking and i open a new tab to show him something. after i showed it to him i close it and turn to continue talking to him. when i closed out the tab, the tab with the comic appears on the screen. he asks me what i was looking at, i look over and see [this](http://www.shadbase.com/the-lezzing-of-korra-page-11/) [nsfw]. i tried to explain to him that it is a comic strip and the creator also does porn every so often, i am certain that he did not believed me. word travels fast here and everyone now thinks that i look at hentai.",everyone now thinks i look at hentai.
763,"so i recently got an in-person job at a cool company. i wanted to wear a skirt as part of the professional look, and i decided to give my legs a good shave. i just do it quick in the shower, but i wanted it close so i decided to do it in the bathtub.

last night i decided to make it relaxing and fun with a some drinking and music. i put the water on, put in a few drops of baby oil, got my ipod player, all that. i only had jack daniels, which i like with ice. i thought i might like a second drink, so i brought the bottle with me and put a lot of ice in the glass.

i get in the tub, drink and bottle on the floor nearby, music going nicely. i just soak and enjoy my drink, put in a little more hot water, and go for another after maybe 20 minutes. huge fucking mistake

i woke up hours later, freezing in the tub, where i apparently spilled most of a handle of jack daniels and soaked in it for two hours. :/ i just started bawling. my roommate confirmed i completely reeked of booze, and it even got into my hair. 

i called the interviewer's office (after hours at this point) and said i was really sick and needed to reschedule and emailed the same thing. fortunately in the morning they said that was fine.",spent today taking tomato juice showers.
764,so this actually happened yesterday... but anyways my dad is out of town for work and my sister just got home from working all summer at a summer camp. my mom asked me to go outside and start up the grill so we could have hot dogs and hamburgers for dinner.  so i start the grill then put the stuff on the grill and look in the corner and saw some older golf clubs. so i grab some iron and go to the lawn and start swinging it.  i live in a neighborhood that backs up to a field so i though why don't i just take an old golf ball and hit it into the field.  so i grab my dads driver out of his back because i don't want to go into the basement to get mine.  i grab a ball and tee and tell my sister to come watch.  so we both go to the backyard and i set up the ball on the tee and take my practice swings.  so now i am thinking i'm just going to crush the ball so i swing i make connection with the ball and the head of the driver goes with the ball. so there i was thinking oh my god. so i put just the shaft back in the garage and go searching in the waist to chest high field.  after that i proceeded to give my arms and legs a 45 minute sponge bath because i got into something that made my legs burn and itch.  this was yesterday and my legs are still red and itchy... i wonder what i went through,"broke the head off my dads driver and had to sponge bathe my legs because they were red, burning and itching"
765,"throwaway for obvious reasons :p

so, it's getting warm where i am and i decided to sleep naked. i love the freedom of it, my boobs rarely get any time out from their ""cage"" and yeah. i laid my head down and went to sleep.

around 7:30 am, way before my alarm, i was half awake. i strained to fart and felt a wetness between my legs. *oh, no. i peed myself.* was my first thought. now, i am not at my best mental capacity at 7:30 in the morning, so i stuck my hand down there to find out what it was. my hand came back bloody.

great. my period had started. no big deal, i'd just run to the bathroom that wasn't far from my room and get a pad, right? right.

except.

when i stood up, the floodgates opened.

i speedwalked to the bathroom (i don't know why i didn't run, again, i am not at my best) but halfway there it appeared this would not be adequate. i had one option, and one option only.

needless to say, i walked the other half to the bathroom with my left hand cupped between my legs. toilet paper was my savior, but when i finally looked at my hand, it was covered in blood. gross.

i got dressed and went back to sleep, this time, protected :p",i perioded in my hand cause i used it as a cup
766,"disclaimer: this is a biggun. not using throwaways, because hey, what could happen?

to start off, i'm a big fan of tf2, clocking in over several hundred hours of playtime when i've got nothing to do. me and my friends have been playing together for well over a year, and it's a lot of fun. but anyways, when the balloonicorn came out as a product on the valve store and thinkgeek, i knew i had to get one. i mean, hey, who doesn't enjoy having an inflatable unicorn from a world of insanity in your home decor? so after checking with my mother (i was thirteen at the time) and ordering it along with some other items, i was set. fast forward to 8/30/2012, where as i eagerly opened and inflated my product, my friends (12 and 9) invited me to their house. i gladly accepted and brought my balloonicorn with me.

after quite a bit of playing there, their mom said that they were going to the school for a meeting and that i can come. once again, i accepted and brought balloonicorn with me. however, i left him in the car. once we got out, we could play in the playground while my friends' mom discussed with the teachers. i hung out on the swings and monkey bars. i was on top of the monkey bars when we were about to head out to play some kickball. naturally, i decided to slide down on the monkey bars and swing off, but my hand slipped. i then managed to hit the front of my bottom teeth on one of the step-bars and then on the ground.

i was bleeding and screaming like bloody heck as my friends came rushing to me. we notified the mom immediately, and she called my mom as i was treated to some cold water from the sink, which didn't help too much. it turns out my mom was unfortunately in the middle of volunteering at the moment, but my dad was at home. so we ended up leaving at the nearest convenience, my buddies comforting me with the balloonicorn. 

i got home several minutes later, with my dad at the front door. i limped over as my friends carried the balloonicorn in. my dad, who is a very christian man and thinks that homosexuality (or even guys liking things that have a bit of a feminine touch besides women themselves) is a sin, was surprised at seeing the large inflatable pink unicorn that the boys carried in. (he didn't know i ordered it.) ""why are you bringing in that pink unicorn?"" he asked. ""that's not ours!"" one of my neighbors exclaimed. ""well, it's not ours, either!"" dad responded. ""yes it is!"" my neighbor yelled as he and his brother shut the door, high-tailed it to their mom's car, and floored it outta here.

by now, i was hanging over the sink, having taken some ibuprofen and letting warm water run down my gore-ish teeth. i heard the entire exposition roll out between the neighbors and my dad, and the steam coming out of his ears was very hot. i can still distinctly remember ""do you want to know a secret"" playing from his computer as my head lay over the sink, as he paced around, seething in furious anger. at this point, he's practically forgotten about my teeth. after a very awkward moment of no speech, he stepped up and asked why the f&€k i had a 'gay-@$$ pink unicorn'. i tried responding, but all that had come out of my mouth was 'bdoniwnghgatgihihgaghnonwcjejeftjpnpohigb'. he didn't get any happier that night. (we still love each other, although he still harshly gets mad at me when i say anything involving homosexuality.)

luckily, this story has a bit of a happy ending. my teeth would have been knocked out if it weren't for two deus ex machinas: my braces, and the lucky fact that my orthodontist lived right across the freaking street. once my wires were replaced, the ortho gave me a school excuse so i could skip tomorrow and messaged my dentist about teeth-trauma-therapy or something (it wasn't too bad; just q-tips sprayed with icy stuff to check if my teeth were still connected.) the following day, i got to stay at home, watch netflix; eat macaroni and cheese, and play tf2 with my genuine balloonicorn. a guy on a koth server started a trade asking for my genuine buddy. i replied 'no'.","i got a balloonicorn online, hit my mouth on the monkey bars, was scolded by my dad for being a 'f@g', went to several therapy things with my dentist, and am still having this incident brought up in conversation to this day.**"
767,"so to be honest it was yesterday-night that i didn't feed my cat. i was tired, the cat is overweight and asks for more food three times a day so i thought she could wait until morning. 


i keep the cat food on top of the washing machine, which is in the attic of my house. this morning i found cat food all around our washing machine as our cat decided to help herself, i cleaned it and fed the cat. 


today i went to work, picked up my kids from daycare afterwards, came home, turned on the washing machine, put on sesame street for my kids and started cooking dinner. 


after about 15 minutes the fire alarm goes of. so i start running around like a chicken with no head and check al the smoke detectors downstairs but non of them had a red light. so i grab the fire extinguisher and run upstairs. half way up i slip on the huge amount of water that comes of the stairs and badly bruise my arm and ankle. i then leave the fire extinguisher downstairs as fire does not seem to be the problem, and get upstairs again to find out water comes from the attic and leaks into a smoke detector, causing it to start the auto destruct sequence of our house. 


i then hear something fall off the stairs and my 11-month old scream like he has never screamed before, so i run/slide downstairs to find out my 11 month-old had followed me up the stairs since i also tifu by leaving the gate open behind me. he also slipped and now has a huge bump on his head. 


so then i picked up my screaming 11-month old, check if he is ok, try to comfort him while running up the stairs again and trying to find a way to stop the auto destruct on our house. which luckily worked. i then go to the attic to find that our cat apparently jumped on the plumbing behind our washer, so that two tubes got disconnected and the washer pumped water straight onto our attic floor. 


so i come downstairs to find that my two year old has used this unsupervised time to first put my phone on some eastern european language (i don't know how to put it back) and secondly is trying to microwave his rabbit (toy).","so not feeding my cat resulted in a water damaged ceiling on our second floor, a huge bump on my kids head, a bruised arm and ankle, a huge mess in my house and my phone in a language that i do not speak."
768,"so i have two flatmates with whom i share one bathroom and shower. we've got a routine and flow for the mornings since we all get up fairly early, where we each have a normal time when we get up and use the shower in order to not overlap. last night we had a bit of a splash that involved each of us drinking a six-pack immediately prior to going to bed. 

now normally when your bladder is full to bursting in the night, you wake up at 4am and fight the battle between getting up and peeing or staying in your warm comfy bed. i sleep hard when facilitated by booze and did not have this opportunity. i woke up at my usual time and realized i had to pee immediately. as soon as i opened my bedroom door i saw the bathroom door close. nooooooo.gif! apparently my flatmate was behind schedule.

i tried to be all zen and focus on other things, emptying my mind like i wanted to empty my bladder, but i could feel my belly as firm as a basketball, and my urethra was all like, ""duuuude, wtf, i can not hold this flood back."" when i found myself actually pinching it off with my fingers i knew i could not wait 15 minutes for the bathroom. i hadn't had to pee this badly since boot camp! i didn't pee myself then (like so many others) and i'd be damned if i did now.

the kitchen sink crossed my mind -- but no! it was full of dishes. 

off the balcony... too risky. landlord lives downstairs. 

i've got an empty plastic liter bottle in my trash -- perfect! its got a small opening so i carefully align and hold my willy in place and release. 

about a third of the way full, the bottle, hot in my hand, was starting to push back. i was displacing the air with my urine and there is no way i could possibly stop at this point. no other receptacle handy. so i carefully broke the seal while maintaining contact and aim... precipitating an ocean spray explosion of piss-mist that got all over my face, keyboard, bed and desk. 

my only thought at that moment: ""doesn't matter; still peed.""

shameful shower and cleanup came later. mostly i'm just glad it was a liter bottle not a 20oz. it was nearly full.",out of desperation i peed in a bottle and caused a cloud of urine to explode in my room.
769,"so, my doctor *thinks* i have something called lichen sclerosus et atrophicus on my foreskin which is essentially like having inflamed wet scar tissue gently hugging your man meat.

anyway, last night i had to turn down sex with the bf because it was hurting enough. it usually just gets inflamed and hurts a bit, but it wasn't feeling right. fast-forward to this morning, i wake up earlier than him and in my sleepy stupor wander downstairs. before i know it, i'm incredibly horny, and completely forgetting about last night, start going to town. i notice about 30 seconds after i finish that there's a slight tingling sensation down there, and with 2 minutes, my dick is on fire. i can hardly stand the pain. the fiery wrath of satan came down upon my genitalia this morning, and even now, 4 hours later, it still hurts.",i fapped with inflamed foreskin and now my dick is on fire
770,"this actually happened last night but it didn't post for some reason. 

my mom made burritos on tuesday night with veggie crumbles and pintos. i should mention that tuesdays are meatless in our house for as long as i can remember. every other night of the week, we have some kind of meat with dinner. so anyway, she served vegetarian burritos and they were really tasty.

when dinner was over, my dad and i did the dishes and she used the leftover beans and veggie crumbles to make leftover burritos and put them in the fridge. lo and behold, everyone in the house was boated and gassy before bedtime on tuesday. my dad and i have this thing about farting in our house. we actively compete with each other for dominance when it comes to loudness and funk. so all night tuesday and into wednesday, i'm letting them rip. today, my parents took me school shopping for next week and before we went into the mall my mom warned my dad and i not to embarrass her.

while we're shopping, i can feel a massive ass bubble forming and tell my folks i'm going to the bathroom. while i was in there, i ripped ass so bad that i almost gagged. i got the hell out of there, thankful that i was all by my lonesome. as we're heading home, i feel another massive swell of ass gas building and let it rip. upon inhaling my noxious fumes of death, my dad conceded defeat for the first time in all of my years, but it was not to last. 

when we got home, i went into the fridge digging for leftovers and found the burritos from tuesday night. i took one out and popped it into the microwave for a late afternoon snack. the old man came in and asked me to heat one up for him too. 

i should have known then that this wasn't going to end well.  

later on, i'm fucking around online while my mom is sitting in her favorite spot on her favorite couch watching tv. my dad slips into my room and unleashes hell through his ass. plotting my revenge, i wait patiently for the buildup of gasses to stir. when they finally hit their crescendo i was almost doubling over in pain. i stealthy make my way out of my room in search of the old man, eager to exact my revenge. when i don't find him, i look out in the garage, only to find his truck gone. 

so i come back inside and see my innocent mother, the woman who feeds me, washes my clothes and has had to put up with the poisonous gas war my father and i have waged for the entirety of my 15 year life. i'm still not sure why i thought it would be a good idea, but i figured why waste a good fart. so i made my approach.

“where's dad?”

“he ran to the store for avocados” 

“okay, here's something i was saving for him.”

with that, i spun around, hung my ass out so that it was just inches from her face and let loose. it's gone so flawlessly before, always without a hitch. so when i felt the seat of my shorts fill up with not just a squirt, or even just a single turd, i knew i had fucked up. because i realized then that i had just shit my pants beyond anything that i had ever imagined. 

my mom, somehow knowing what i had planned, put her hands on my ass to push it out of her face. so as a pit of brown pythons filled my pants with stunning speed, she had her hand pressed straight into it. needless to say, she wasn't exactly laughing with my dad when he came home. he triumphed again, and my poor, poor saint of a mother became a casualty in our war for dominance.","_ i tried to fart in my mom's face, shit my pants instead."
771,"today, me and the wife were watching whose line is it anyway on the ipad while lying in bed. the cat was at the foot of the bed and i wanted to pet him; so i pet him with my foot.

suddenly, my wife looks over and says ""babe, what are you doing? you're rubbing stormy's butt."" i looked down and said ""hey, i guess i am"" and continued, not thinking of the consequences. 

all of a sudden, his fur was really wet, i couldn't understand it, what happened? i look down and realize i had moved my toes up and had been stroking his tiny, kitty manhood with my toes.

he promptly got up and walked away, presumably to smoke a cigarette.",stroked my cat to an orgasm
772,"today i made a mistake that i feel is somewhat common, but terrible nonetheless. recently there has been a heatwave where i live. we've had a little over a week of 100+ days. so after working in the shop all day i was hot and thirsty, to say the least. well sitting in the cup holders of my truck is two bottles, one is a spitter for chew and the other is tea from lunch, both in the same style bottle. i can imagine you know where this is going. i was so thirsty i didn't pay attention to which bottle i grabbed. i grabbed the spitter and took a big swig of it. instantaneous nausea. it was so terrible that i had to pull over and ended up losing the contents of my stomach in the ditch. lesson learned, pay a little more attention next time.",drank from a spitter instead of the tea next to it in my 100 degree truck.
773,"last night but whatever, fixing a fuck-up is more critical than this. here goes:

background: i'm a sophomore in college and people have just started moving in. i've also been in contact with a girl over the summer and we hook up sometimes. it's fairly serious but nothing official yet.

the incident: i'm at the frat party we were hosting. i invited all my friends from last year to come(including the girl) and it is going well. i've only had three drinks, and my bro comes and starts pouring shots for every one. i match a few freshmen, go to play some slap-cup, and blackout. this occurred around 12:30.

a different female friend of mine tells me the rest. she asks me to take her back to her dorm cuz she's bored. i also agree because i notice summer-girl leaving the party as well and it is in the same direction. at least i hope that was the reasoning. this was around 1am.

once in the dorm, i start wandering trying to find the exit. being too drunk to function, other friend tries to get me to lay down while she charges her phone, and when she looks away, i book it without any explanation. this was at around 1:30.

sometime around 3-4 am, i regain some consciousness and realize i'm in the hospital, and i try to leave. everything is hazy and i stick to the walls. my pants are also covered in my own piss. like, covered. christ it was bad. the nurse tells me i can't leave yet (i think because of 'paperwork'?) and i get belligerent, but eventually go back to the hospital bed. around 5 minutes later, a cop(not sure if campuspd or real cops) tells me to follow him, i get in his car, and he drives me to my dorm. i then re-lose consciousness, and wake up at 9:30 am almost naked on my bed, no phone or keys, but my clothes were beside the bed in a pile.

the aftermath: after helping move in freshmen, i spent the rest of today tearing apart my room trying to find my stuff. i also ran into my  other friend, who told me what she knew about my night. meanwhile, i didn't even know i saw her yesterday. i eventually find my keys and access card, saving me a good hundred bucks on replacement fees. i still haven't found my phone. since it is dead, find my iphone doesn't work. after searching everywhere i was, including the hospital, i'm certain it is lost forever somewhere on that walk back home. i also got an email from the disciplinary board and i have to meet with them tmrw to discuss my hospitalization. and to top it all off, the girl i like got really distant with me today, and i have no idea how to fix it or what specifically i did wrong.","got drunk as fuck, got hospitalized on my way back home, and now my phone is gone and everyone is pissed at me, including myself."
774,"the breakup wasn't accidental, but it certainly didn't occur how i hoped it would. we just had our one year anniversary, but things were not well for us, we've been drifting apart recently. we talked about the possibility of breaking up a few days ago and i've been thinking about it since. she just started a new job and we haven't seen each other as much as we used to. anyways, she texted me tonight saying how she feels like she is to blame for us being distant and i told her not to blame herself. then i fucked up by saying ""maybe it's just time"" and the conversation spiraled out of my control from there. i know she deserves better than me and much better than that. it's hard to believe its over because of that and i feel like a complete asshole. i mostly wanted to get that off my chest. throwaway because i can.",i feel like a dick for accidentally breaking up with the girl who is in love with me via text message.
775,"so, i'm a kinky gal. i have a bit of a voyeuristic side. i just started class a few days ago and today i decided why not be naughty and wear a buttplug to class today?  stupid stupid me decided to wear a pear of loose shorts because it's still fairly hot out. i've never worn a buttplug out without wearing jeans or yoga pants. guess it was those, not my clenching skills, that typically held the plug in place.

shortly after my first class walking through the hallway i felt the plug begin to slip. panicking, i began to quick walk to the restroom clenching my cheeks, but to no avail, the plug slipped out, right passed my undies, out the bottom of my shorts. i have no idea if anyone noticed, but i bolted for the lady's room and hid in the stall for a good 10 minutes.",lost my favorite buttplug
776,"alright, not sure if this post will make you cringe, but sure as *hell* made me cringe. so i'm attending a dance tonight, and i though to myself, ""hey, why not play some video games to chillax for a bit?""i hop on the 'ole xbox and launch the first game that catches my eye in my half-assed collection: call of duty black ops ii. first mistake. i'm a notoriously loud serial rager, and have one helluva potty mouth to boot. second mistake? deciding to try and raise my k/d. you can probably see where this is going. anyways, i get into a few lobbies, quit, play a bit and then quit, and decide to play some kill confirmed on raid. its one of my favorite maps in the game, so i decide to go tryhard.fast forward to my second vsat streak; i'm one measly confirm away from my vsat, and decide to call in my chopper. bad move.next thing i know, jimmy quickscopes comes up and gats me, causing me to scream a hearty, ""fucking faggot!"" into my mic.no big deal, right? everyone rages. wrong.see, today is a friday night. which means my younger and *impressionable as hell* kid sister has piano lessons. with her openly gay piano instructor.added bonus: since i have a dance to attend, i get to awkwardly shuffle by them as i leave.*shit.*","i screamed ""fucking faggot!"" while my impressionable kid sister and her openly gay piano instructor were out in the living room. i get to walk by them in about 20 minutes."
777,"they bought the gift last saturday, but i finally saw my mom today to give her the gift.

my mom opens the box to find a lovely snow globe for grandmothers. she goes ""ooh, that's very pretty"" and then realizes it plays music. she asked what song it played so we wound it up a little while i checked the bottom of the box. i told her that it played ""wind beneath my wings"" and she looked as though she was going to cry and said quietly that it was my aunt's favorite song. my aunt, her sister, passed away about 10 years ago. she loved the song because she was military and bette midler (i believe) did a uso show during the first gulf war and sang that song. 

i felt like crap because, had i been in the store with them to pick it out, i could have stopped them from getting that snow globe that plays that particular song.",i gave my mom a mother's day gift that my son picked out and it made her cry because she misses her deceased sister.
778,"i don't have great writing skills, english isn't even my first language, but i'd like to submit this little fuck up. so here is a little background story, i am in junior high, and my class has always been a troublesome bunch, this year, a few new people entered my class, i became especially fond of a girl, about 2 years older than me.
 now, nothing out of the ordinary so far, except, that now i find myself in an opposite side of a little quarrel, in one side there are a few people not worth mentioning, except her twin sister  (let's call her j, i'll explain later), and in another side, me and a few friends (some of them go back more than 10 years), and another girl which i also know for about a decade (i'll be referring to her as m).

the problem is as follows:
     some of my crushes friends have been cracking a few wise-ass jokes, not targeting anyone in particular, but m seems to think it is directed to her and her friends (teenage girls ಠ_ಠ). and j said one of those jokes, only once, (or maybe not, bear in mind, this is an extremely confusing situation). m was going to go to the principal, because she considered it verbal bullying, j heard that she was also going to point out her name, even though she only said it once, and felt betrayed or something.
 
j has some information about m, very sensitive personal information, (she is 15, dating a 26 year old, that works in the school, this wouldn't be an issue, because the age of consent is 14 where i live, but as per school policy, school workers can't date students, needless to say this would get the dude fired). now, j threatened m that if she mentioned her name to the principal, she would tell about the information, which is pretty low. also needless to say, all hell breaks lose, first on the classroom, then on facebook, i try to keep myself out of it, but... i can't resist, such stupidity, in it's purest form, it lures me like a raccoon is lured to a trash bin. i start to make a point, not offending anyone, after long hours of comment wars, it's pretty safe to say me and my friends ""won"". but then, j deletes the thread. basically throwing a hissy fit, this doesn't bother me, not so far at least. but then, her sister (my crush, lets call her d) arrives, and says we have been talking crap about her sister, of which she is very protective, she is... hmm, how can i put this, tomboy-ish? she doesn't understand what happened and is extremely mad. she fully supports her sister, it's a pretty dumb thing to do, but somehow i manage to love her, it's one of the thing i like about her, her stubbornness. i believe she is now angry at me and my friends. we were on opposite sides of the battlefield, i think i just blew every chance i had. oh and today i got hit in the face with an umbrella.","don't be a lazy fuck, read it."
779,"okay so, today my mom, sister, and, dad went out while i was in school (i'm home-schooled). well during my break i got on reddit and was browsing around when i felt the need to fap, well, i'm weird and i was just looking around on r/hentai when i found this really good picture of one of my favorite anime characters in a...well... indecent...position. i proceed do make some knuckle children and went to my next class. fast forward a little bit and my family had come back for a quick stop to drop off my dad and then they all left again to run some more errands. well my sister and my dad both walked by my room with this picture enlarged on my screen. i being oblivious to this fact continued on like everything was normal, until they had left i and was done with class and i walk into my room scream ""oh fuck"" and realized what i had done.

780,"so here i was in my english class having a casual conversation when all the sudden my teacher gave my class some concerning news regarding her pregnancy. there was some sort of complication with the functionality in the baby's heart (i'm not too positive on the details) and she told us that she would be absent for a while.

upon hearing the semi-shitty news, i just said without thinking, ""abort the mission!"" it was fucked up--everyone was staring at me with dropped jaws and shortly thereafter i realized that i was a fucking tool for saying that. i sat the rest of the class drenched in sweat because i was so embarrassed.

after class, i apologized for what i said and my teacher laughed it off. regardless of her mercy, i fucked up.",told my teacher to abort her baby.
781,"so today i fucked up. not one noticed by anyone i knew (thank god), but a fuck up nonetheless. i was woke up by a friend in scotland who kiked me at 3am est, which is around 8am for her. before i woke up, i had a bj dream (happens on occasion, never results in the following). now we chat and she leaves for school, so i fall asleep again to the same dream. here's where the fuck up comes in. my brain, being the horny teen brain it is, decides to escalate the dream a bit further to a full on sex dream. and the dream... escapes the mind and shoots into reality... shoots it right into my favorite boxers... i wake up to a very good feeling and a hard boner. then i realized that that feeling was an orgasm. the damage was devastating. i didn't risk the trash can, i chucked the cum-soaked boxers out the window... today i fucked up. i fucked up my mood. i fucked up my morning. and i fucked up my favorite boxers... 

in retrospect, this could have been prevented by making the bed and not sleeping on the bare, comfy, luxurious mattress. 

 

/u/shitbaggins tl;dr: til what a wet dream is","i jizzed in my pants. not just any pants, my favorite pants."
782,"my building is running new internet cables and have been in my building for a few weeks. when we first found out i cleaned my apartment and made sure it was ready for them to run. we then had a meeting and the landlord told us that we would have a door hanger telling us two days before anyone would be in our apartments. so i relaxed and kept up a bit but not fully. 

today i came home to find my and all my neighbors doors wide open with dudes running from one room to another. i didn't think much of it and went to a movie as to not disturb them. as i was waiting for the movie to start i started thinking if i had anything embarrassing...and then it hit me. my fucking fleshlight is drying in the bathroom. i live in a studio apartment and the bathroom is very visible from the main room, luckily it was up against the wall and they would have had to actually go into my bathroom to see it. 

i came home from the movie just now and they were done. i did not know where they were running the cable, but it turned out to be through the closet. i have a fairly large stack of playboys and front magazines that i have accumulated through the years in the top of my closet. this stuff isnt great and i have the internet so i dont use them for spank material. however when i walked into my room everything was back in its place just how i left it except the gentlemen's magazines, which were nicely stacked in my chair.","maintenance left all my porn out for me, narrowly missed my fucktoy"
783,"so, i went on a trip for a few days, driving from florida to indianapolis and back. on the way up, i had a tire crack due to dry rot (and proceeded to drive over 900 miles with a severely left-pulling car, thinking the alignment was off.) replacing the tire in indy ate up most of my available funds for the spontaneous trip, and i ended up vacationing very sparsely on borrowed money.

on the way home, my car (which was pushing 100k miles) started really struggling to accelerate. it wouldn't go above 40-45 mph, even when i pushed the pedal as hard as i could. at first, i thought my little scion was struggling with the mountainous terrain of tennessee, but the problem persisted the whole way home, turning a 19-hour straight-through drive into a 23-hour drive and making me late (and dead tired) to work the next day.

after borrowing even more money, i took my car to get a basic fluid change, hoping the issue was transmission fluid or something. $40, no change. the oil change place recommended a new air filter. $30. they said it didn't look too bad, but the car was at 100k miles so i figured, better do it. still no change. next, they recommended a fuel filter change.

well, the fuel filter in a scion can only be changed by ripping out the whole seat, so off to the dealership we go. $320 and a new fuel filter later, i get a call from mike at the dealership telling me to come pick the car up. when i arrived, this is what i was told:

""so, we changed the fuel filter out. it didn't look like it was too bad, but the car's at 100k miles so we changed it. we don't think that was your problem, as the filter wasn't very clogged. we put the whole seat assembly back together. when we did, we noticed your floormat was curled up and jammed under the gas pedal, so we pulled that out for you.""",spent $400 and panicked the whole way home from a vacation to find my car wasn't accelerating because the fucking floormat was crammed under the gas pedal.
784,"did not happen today, but i feel if i post the story i may be able to let this one go for good.

it was the morning after a rousing night of drinking and sleeping on a friend's couch with several other drunk hooligans. i chugged some water and headed out to my old soft-top jeep wrangler. i had taken the top off for the summer, but the driver and passenger front side window halfs of the doors were still on it.

i went to open the driver's side door and it just wouldn't budge. i pulled, i jiggled, and finally crawled through the passenger side. the door wouldn't open from the inside either. at this point, hungover friend #1 stumbles out and asks what's up. i explain the situation and he proceeds to try to get it open for himself, and of course, can't do it.

i could have said ""fuck it"" and gone about my day, but no, you see, i am a mechanical engineering student. it's a simple mechanical malfunction, and i should just go ahead and fix it to prevent crawling through my passenger side / window for the next week. hf#1 (chemical engineering) and i proceed to start taking things apart, trying to get to the jammed mechanism.

after a good half hour, hungover friend #2 comes out, another mechanical engineering major, and gets in on the action. we finally get the window top-half off, and can now access the door easier. hungover friend #3 (materials engineering) comes out and also helps. as it turns out, this is no simple task. it's almost impossible to take a jeep door off while it is closed.

four hours go by with us removing bolts and parts - frustrated and determined. but it is no matter, for we are engineers! we crawled all over the inside and outside of that thing.

it's in the middle of summer, so not only are we hungover but also getting pretty sunburned out there. the door finally comes off and we go about inspecting it. ""it appears there's some kind of latch that's stuck closed over here... hmmm.... peculiar... well we should probably take it apart."" hf #2 starts messing with the handle and door lock, when: pop! the mysterious latch disappears and is no longer in the way.

it was then that we realized that the door had been locked. that was why it would not open.

i had let my dad borrow that jeep the day prior and he had locked the door. who locks a jeep wrangler with no top!?

we spent the afternoon reassembling my car. at this point a good portion of the windshield and roll-cage were taken apart, and we had stripped a few screws... so... it took until sunset. we then began drinking once more.

785,"so i'm at work and i go for my usual morning shit.  pants down, sit down on the can, start business, open up words with friends.  son of a bitch landed 50 points on his turn.

hear/feel something odd.

look down and realize that somehow my dick has achieved *just* the right angle to piss right through the tiny gap between the toilet seat and bowl, spraying the back of my khakis and the floor.  i do my best to clean up and dry everything off, but there's still a noticeable dark spot smack dab in the middle of my ass.  i live too far away to go change, have no backup pants here, and no easy way to disappear and clean them.

786,"before you guys go here and judge me for smoking weed or going to school under the influence, i'm a sixteen year old kid working 30+ hours a week and going to school everyday. it has been stressing me out and usually i do nothing about it until recently my friend said that i should smoke during lunch to de-stress and everything would be fine and that i just needed a break. so i gave into peer pressure, big whoop. well, it gets worse. when i get back from lunch after smoking a few bowls with a group of close friends, i start feeling it alllllll slip awayyyy. we were using the school computers and this kid in the class before ours left his account logged in. one of my buddies tells me that it is this kid who tried to sleep with my girlfriend and who was talking shit about me. me and my intoxicated self, having a grudge on this kid, thinks that it would be hilarious to delete all of the saved files on the school's shared drive. the kid is in this e-commerce class and had a **huge** project due that would be over 50% of his grade. so, me, in the current mental state i'm in, wipes this kid's files completely clean. nothing left. but that isn't where i drew the limit. i went on to write html code that popped up and said ""damn dude, that blows"" and had a sequence of images of kids who went to our school and said ""so who was it"" in red letters. kind of extreme for me but oh well. the kid failed the class, and wrongfully accused another student whom is getting suspended until next school year. worst thing worst, it was the wrong guy i did it to.","i screwed over a kid, thinking it was someone else, and got a different kid suspended.**"
787,"i am in grade 11 bio. each week my teacher expects us to take home the class pet, a hamster, for the day. when i say this thing was ugly, i mean ugly. it had crap pouring down its eyes, and it shit on the same spot because it could barely move its hind legs. any ways, besides being allergic and hating the thing, my teacher made me take the pest home. 

my parents also hated the so called animal, and made me keep it in my room. here is where the fun starts.

the thing was noisy (i do not understand how it made so much noise for the little almost-half-paralysed creature it was, but hell behold it did), and it smelled up my room with the combination of piss and ass.

never the less, in the barley concious state i was in at 4am (my throat is clogged and my eyes are swollen from my allergies), the thing started screaming.

yes, a hamster was screaming. 

i, to shut the thing up, grabbed my alarm clock (that was going to be off in about 2 hours with out me getting a wink of sleep) and threw it as hard as i could at the cage. 

and just like that it was silent. too silent. i didn't even hear its normal sniffling. with every drop of adrenaline, i ran towards the (class beloved) pet and turned on the lamp to see that it was dead. at first i wasn't sure, but after taking it out, and its mouth hanging open with identically open wide eyes, i realized i gave it a heart attack.

today at school, i brought it in the class and told everyone that it died in his sleep. some girls actually started crying and the teacher was ready to take the day off. (she had the hamster for 7 years) my class decides to make a funeral, yes a funeral. my teacher, thinking i was upset and suffering from some kind of pts asked me to be the one with the honour of buring it and talking about its last few hours of life.

so rest in peace tanner(not the real name just in case a classmate sees this)  you will not be missed and i hope you get replaced with a fish.

my class is pretty upset, they keep saying it wasn't my fault, and some guy i think likes me almost beat up another guy up for saying it was.

i'm sorry but i do not feel guilty which sounds bad, i didn't want to bring the thing home.

788,"so a few days ago in last period we were just hanging out in the art room waiting for dismissal. since i am the one who usually says random things to see peoples reaction (not to hurt anyone's feelings). i come up with the genius idea of going halfway across the room and sitting at the teachers table (only 10 kids in class so half the tables are empty) and saying i want to be a hitman or assassin. she says why and i say because my name implies it and she says ""then you should be a butcher"". then i say ""no it means mass murder and that's what assassins do"" then she says ""ok... you know i have to tell the principal right?"" and then i knew i was screwed so i just accepted it.

so the next day i go to first period and within a minute of me getting their security gets me and takes me to the principals office. i was in their for an hour and they searched and questioned me. i thought i was off the hook since we only talked about the incident for 5 minutes they left for half an hour (probably to search my locker and car), came back and said to not say things like that and sent me back to class. 

now that i got home my mom called and said the principal wants my mental health evaluated. i don't think i will be able to stay in school because i said this when tensions in the country are high.

789,"in november we finally moved into our new house that has a man made koi pond in the back. fast forward to the ""spring"" (i put that in quotes given how crazy the weather has been in the northeast) and we decided to clean it out and fix it up, as it hadn't been well maintained in the last year before we moved in. we drained the water from the pond and took out all the fish and put them in a bucket. we kept the water from the pond in the bucket and all the fish were fine (about a dozen or so fish.) i realized that we needed to keep this water in there and that if we switched it with say, tap water, the fish could die. however, i forgot to tell my wife this, who would then convey this information to my mother in law who is staying with us to watch our daughter. mother in law doesn't speak any english so the only way to communicate is through my wife.

fast forward to today (well technically yesterday but i didn't get a chance to post this then) and i come home from work and my dad comes over to measure the pond. he then yells out to me, ""hey! all the fish are dead!"" i declare ""bullshit!"" but then i went over and sure enough, the bucket had become a fish graveyard. a dozen or so fish of various sizes all floating on the top. i also noticed that the water was much cleaner than it was beforehand. turns out my mil decided to change the water and apparently the fish couldn't handle it and thus it killed them all. i felt bad because a: my older daughter had started to like to the fish and would watch them and feed them, and b: they survived all fall and winter in the pond only to later die what was probably a rather painful death. now we have to buy all new fish once we get this pond up and running:",drained pond and stored fish in bucket. mother in law changed water because i forgot to tell her not to and ended up killing all our fish.

791,"i apologize in advance for any formatting errors, i'm on my phone. 

both of my classes today were cancelled, and i wasn't scheduled to work, so i figured i should so something productive with my time and decided to go donate blood. not a big deal, i'm o- so they get me in there as much as they possibly can. 

donation went fine, no problems there. after i had finished, i went home, had lunch and then headed to the library for a few hours to work on a paper. finished up, headed home, decided to make myself dinner. 

i've had a ton of this boxed off-brand macaroni and cheese sitting around for a while now, and decided to try to get rid of some. cooked it, ate about a third of it, felt full but nothing out of the ordinary (yet). 

my night continued as my friend and i decided to head to our favorite bar to play some cornhole -- their outdoor bar opened up a few weeks ago and there's a killer cornhole scene, if cornhole scenes are even a thing. i was slowly sipping on a bourbon and ginger with no intention of getting drunk, since 1) i have class tomorrow morning and 2) i gave blood this morning so my tolerance is shot to hell. i ended up drinking maybe a quarter of my drink. we stayed for a couple of hours, and the entire time i slowly started to feel sicker and sicker. we finished up our last game, and as we were closing out our tabs at the bar, i burped. it was wet. and tasted like acid mixed with the orange powder stuff that makes shitty mac and cheese oh so delicious. bad news. 

at this point, i warned my friend that it was going to be brain over barf the whole way home, and she reassured me that i could just puke in a bush if worst came to worst. i held it in the entire way back to my apartment, and headed straight for the bathroom once i got in the door. genius me decided it would be an awesome idea to pee beforehand, but my genius colon decided now would be a good time to release some awesome smelling shit as well. the pressure being put on my abdomen from shitting cause me to start to puke, so i immediately hopped up off the toilet and spun around, flushing just in time to smack my forehead into the toilet seat. 

i wasn't anticipating the smell. to be fair, i don't know what i was expecting since i just witnessed myself shitting into the very same toilet. i finally puked. unfortunately, whatever demon combination of mac and cheese and shit smell that i was undergoing at the time caused me to projectile vomit so hard that the chunks of puke ricocheted back up to hit me in the face, causing me to puke again. 

all in all i paid my respects to the porcelain god for ten minutes before i decided i was good enough to try to go to sleep. i cleaned up, went into the kitchen to get some water, and wandered past my confused roommates and into bed. it took maybe three sips of water before my stomach revolted again, and i went into the bathroom to puke some more. 

currently i'm sitting on the bathroom floor trying to see if it's feasible to even sleep in my bed tonight. i can't go more than two minutes without throwing up (even though i have nothing left to throw up at this point). so yeah. 

 



**edit: but wait, there's more!**

i ended up going to bed right after i posted this (around 2am i think), but only slept for like an hour before waking up and puking again. got back into bed, slept for three whole hours this time, and then made the worst mistake i've ever made. (i wish i were making this up.) i was laying on my stomach and the urge to fart appeared. in my sleep-addled mind, i thought ""sure, go for it, you've been puking and shitting all night, but definitely trust this fart!""

bad news again. a foul combination of mostly water and also probably mac and cheese exploded out of my ass. luckily, i was wearing those shorts that have built in underwear, so the toxic waste was contained and i was able to jump down from my bed and waddle to the bathroom. shit some more. puked some more. took a shower to clean myself up. finally, around 6:30am, i went back to sleep. thankfully, i stayed asleep until 10 minutes ago (3:30pm), missing all of my classes and still managing to feel like shit when i woke up. awesome.","gave blood, ate mac and cheese, played cornhole, reverse ate mac and cheese out of both ends."
792,"i came home from a job interview and turned the tv on as per western culture. whilst searching for suitable background noise that i could repeat should i be arrested and need to explain i was home watching tv by saying what was on.

then i had that empty pain in my stomach. it was then that my mind flashed back through the day and was shocked to see i had not eaten that day. so off to the kitchen i went, i carefully climbed the obstacle course that is a man's city apartment. i climbed mount ironing and swam through lake spilt coffee.

i approached the kitchen and with a feeling of being god himself i declared ""let there be light!""
i reached for the switch that would be in instrument of my divinity.
at that very moment god sent down a thunderbolt to spite the heathen i was!
the lights in the kitchen exploded! they shook the room with the power of an angry god. the bulbs shattered in the bang and pieces flew through the air with such grace. shards of glass bounced from counter to cupboard and some into the toaster!

when this happened my only thought was how glad i was i had already had my afternoon poo. otherwise i would have been calling for a counter reset.

it was at that moment that i was plunged into darkness! i had no lights, no lamps, not even the glow of the microwave clock that taunts me daily with its time traveling power!

the i am. barefoot in the dark in a room now coated with glass pieces. oh fuck i thought!

i then decided to be a man and go about a decisive resolution to the matter. i walked confidently telling myself that i will be fine and a few minor cuts couldn't hurt me. oh how wrong was i? i had chunks of glass in my foot and still i could not see.

eventually i found an old torch who's light emitting abilities resembled a wet match. it was all i had.

i could see doorways so i navigated to the circuit breaker. once there i checked that nothing had tripped, i then tripped and reset again. no luck!

i pulled the glass out of my foot and put odd shoes on. examined the light to see the caps were still in. i'm a man, i know what to do. i looked for tools, what kind of man hasn't got a tool box? me it would seem.

i then asked the woman next door if she had any. she appeared with some almost instantly! now i'm a man with bright pink pliers!

removing the caps was easy, holding the torch in my mouth because surely it must be clean.

now i put bulbs in all on my own.

still no power? what is this man to do? so i called my mother.

she tells me to go back to the breaker. i stand there as she asks what parts i can see. she tells me to find another panel with switches. i see a panel with a screw on it. i decide this is it and with reckless abandon i start to remove parts of the mains supply. it's then i see the notice saying removing this panel can lead to death or serious injury. i decide i'm not that brave and abandon it.

now my mother says ""anything else on the wall?"" to which i say ""there's this big box that wires go into."" suddenly i saw a flap! i lifted to find tens of switches! all down! i flip them up and just like god i made light.

i walk back to my tv with a bloody foot and having missed the tv show.",i'm going to prison for murder.
793,"i'm your average undergraduate student. i also happen to be doing a summer placement with someone from prof n.'s team. the professor in question is a legend in his field. the kind of guy who has been on tv many many times and is very well known in the country.  



i'm not starting my lab placement until may, but i happen to work in the same building as his team, so my supervisor-to-be thought it would be a good idea for me to attend their weekly meetings if i was available. 

i happened to be available this time, so i headed off to my first meeting ever... but first, i decided to check something very quickly with my current supervisor (*mistake #1*). 

when i checked the time, the weekly meeting had already started 15 min earlier... not wanting to disappoint my supervisor-to-be, i still decided to go. or at least check if it had already started/finished.

i should mention that when my supervisor-to-be said ""we meet every week"" i understood ""we""= himself and a phd student (*mistake #2*). oh boy, how wrong was i... i checked his office only to find no one inside. on my way back, i noticed that there were voices coming from a seminar room. 

bingo! that must be it! that's were they are!

the clever side of me says it's too late to join, come back next week... he knows you are busy, after all. 

as i started making my way back, my suddenly adventurous self convinces me that hey, maybe the meeting is supposed to be 1 hour long, who knows... you might not be *that* late... 

after 2 minutes of awkward hesitation in front of the room, i built up as much courage as i could and opened that door (*mistake #3*), only to reveal a selection of very important people around a table, the whole meeting being chaired by prof n. 

*fuck, what have i done?! fuck fuck fuck*

-""errmm... i'm sorry and... i'm sorry for being late and interrupting...ermm i..."" *nervously lowers head while still standing at the door* 

professor n. stares at me with a face similar to the one in the banner of /r/cringe and asks ""ok... who are you?!""

my cringe-o-meter was off the roof at this point.

my supervisor-to-be tries to save the day by informing prof n. of my oh-so-insignificant identity, which is followed by a friendly ""hi, i'm prof n"" and a handshake. even though it was an awkward-as-fuck handshake (and i was still unable to speak intelligible words), i thought everything was done... end of the cringe.

however i decided to seal this embarrassing masterpiece: **i headed towards my seat by walking between prof n's and someone else's legs and the table [like this](http://i.imgur.com/kxvmuiv.jpg).** *(mistake #4*)

as i sat, my insides cringed furiously and the meeting ended almost immediately. 

i'm still cringing. can't wait until next week...

796,"background information - i'm seventeen, i play violin in a youth orchestra in the uk and this happened two or three months ago, i don't know why i haven't shared it yet.

so i was alone one day for quite a few hours, and i was left to cook my own dinner. now, i'm lazy, even for a seventeen year old, so i just got a large can of sweetcorn, a spoon, added salt and spent the afternoon slowly eating it whilst playing a bunch of snes games. living the fucking life.

the day after, i had to be up at four am to catch a coach to birmingham to play in a concert, along with several other youth orchestras from around the country. now, at this point, i hadn't pooped for something like eleven hours after eating the corn, plus at least another 3 or 4 hours before i ate the corn, but i was running late so i had to pinch it back and soldier on to catch the coach.

come 6am, i'm on the coach, and i'm a fucking wreck. i had pins and needles all over, tunnel vision, my hands were shaking, i was borderline delirious, i needed a shit that badly. unless you've been in the same situation i was in, you might think i'm exaggerating, but i'm sure some of you reading this will know the sheer pain of not being able to go poo for hours. mercifully, the coach pulled over for petrol eventually and i had the most relieving dump ever. i thought that was the end of my problems, but no. oh noooo.

literally minutes before we're meant to go on stage and the feeling comes back but oh so much worse. the toilets were too far away; i couldn't make a run for it, we could have been called on at any moment. so i sit there, on stage, for 20 minutes, battling through symphonies, tears in my eyes, trying so hard not to cack myself in front of all these people. there were photographers from the classic fm website present, britain's top classical music radio station. the only one i'm in i'm wincing. eventually, we get off stage and i go poo. the only damage to my underwear was a single piece of corn.","ate loads of corn, nearly shit myself on stage, didn't, still counting my blessings today."
797,"i've lurked around tifu for a while and it only dawned on me now that this might be a good story to share.  my family gets a good laugh out of it nowadays, so here you guys go:

when i was about five my parents (both far from religious) thought it'd be good to bring my younger sister and me to church just to see if we liked it. it was one of those churches where they do a fair bit of singing and put their hands up in the air. i'm getting a bit confused as to why people are putting their hands up, so i ask my dad. he doesn't know why, but he tells me that they're trying to get closer to god. now at this point i had always thought that god was some magical ruler that lived up in the clouds, so hearing about these people trying to physically reach him seemed ridiculous. they were obviously never going to be able to reach him when they couldn't even reach the ceiling.  i needed to help these people. so, that's about when i started running around the church screaming ""put down your hands, you're never going to reach god!"" over and over and over again.  my parents were pretty embarrassed, a few people looked at me like i was the antichrist, my dad broke out into uncontrollable laughter, and we never went to church again.  i might have been a bit of a handful when i was a kid.

i'll add that neither i nor anyone else in my immediate family have anything against religious folk, this was just me being an idiot child that wanted to help out.","*when i was five i ran around a church screaming, ""put down your hands, you're never going to reach god"" because i wanted to help.*"

this is the most i've seem him puke to date.  i'm still amazed that he kept laughing through the whole thing.

none of it got on him, or the furniture, or the floor.  the entirety of the eruption was on myself.  up the nose, in my ear, a bit in my mouth, all over the shirt, and the beard....  oh god, the beard...

i wouldn't say that my beard is ""magnificent,"" but i would say that it rivals many of my friends' beards.  think of it like a red fro on my chin.  super absorbent.  i could smell it for the rest of the day and most of the next.

799,"this is actually a former friend that did this.

saw an ask science post today that reminded me of this story.  happened several years ago but figured it's good to share as it teaches a good lesson.

http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1m9vrn/are_there_real_physical_dangers_in_eating/

the guy that runs our local nerd store has a tendency to get on obsessive kicks.  it started with energy drinks - to support his energy drink habit, he would sell energy drinks so he could get them cheap.  this evolved into hand sanitizer, cigars, and eventually a variety of hot sauces.  he offered a very wide variety of sauces, nearly none of which i have ever seen elsewhere.

one day one of the regulars comes in (let's call him dummy) and sees the sauces.  he immediately starts bragging about how he can handle any sauce and how he's drunk several different kinds before.  no one eggs him on, just kind of a ""cool story bro"" type situation with this guy, as he does this a lot.  he won't let it go though and keeps insisting that he could drink the hottest sauce in the store.

on top of one of the display cases was the hottest sauce that the store had.  it was in a glass skull and sealed with wax.  the container was about 2 oz. and came with an eye dropper.  directions said to use one drop per gallon of whatever liquid to which it was being added.  there was a warning label that rivals those on some industrial machinery and a scoville rating over 1 million.  dummy decides he is going to drink the whole thing.

lucky for dummy we manage to talk him down from actually drinking the stuff and convince him to just use the eye dropper.  within a few seconds there are tears running down his face, his eyes are red and he's making very strange noises.  the guy chokes the stuff down and recovers a little, but his lips and tongue both start swelling pretty bad.  he ended up leaving pretty quickly after that and we didn't hear from him for a couple weeks.

we heard a little while later that he had developed huge blisters on his tongue and throat and he had trouble eating for a while.  i don't think i ever actually saw the guy again after the incident.  there were reports that he ended up in the hospital for a while because he couldn't breath from the damage to his throat, but i don't know if that part is true.

800,"first of all, i'm typing this on my phone, so i apologize for any spelling/grammar errors in advance.

okay, so, i'm in high school, and i was just happily going about my day until i get into my music period, which is my second to last period. it's pretty great, we just sit around and play music blah blah. so, i lent my friend one of my guitar picks, and at the end of class she came to give it back. now i had totally forgotten about it, and instead of giving it back she thought it would be funny to drop down my shirt. so she did. 

the guitar pick fell through my shirt, and into my pants. i knew it was there, but i couldn't grab it, because i was standing in the middle of class and was not going to stick my hand down my pants and feel around my ass to find it. i figured it'd just fall out through my shorts eventually, so i just started heading towards my next class.

only it didn't fall out through my shorts.

no, no, it got stuck in my underwear and decided to lodge itself into my asscrack. now, for some stupid reason, instead of heading to the bathroom and pulling it out then and there, i decided to just keep going to class. when i get there, i notice a problem for the first time.

if i sit down, that little fucker is gonna fly up my ass like a penis in a porno. 

but i decide to do it anyways. i sit, and that bitch does exactly that. at this point, i figure i should excuse myself to the restroom and get i out, but i'm worried that it will get too deep in to get out if i do, because the nearest bathroom was far away. so i make a decision.

i'm pulling that fucker out.

i reached into my pants while sitting down, squirm a little, and stick my fingers in my asscheecks. i feel around for a second, find the bastard, and rip it out. my fingers emerge slightly wet, smelly, and with a guitar pick in hand. then a thought hits me... 

i was just squirming around in a chair, with my hand in my ass, and then pulled out a guitar pick. fuck. 

 

edit: of course, my most upvoted post ever is a self post about getting a guitar pick stuck in my ass.","i got a guitar pick stuck in my ass, pulled it out, and now fear being known as the guy who fingers his own asshole in class."

802,"(this is from two summers ago, but trust me, it's worth it.)

summer of '11. me, my girlfriend at the time, and 4 other friends went to the beach for 3 days. we were all out of our sophomore year of high school, so clearly, any couples there were finding new places to fornicate in. my gf and i were no exception to this rule. however, also like the responsible honor students we all were, we brought booze and weed with us. so let us begin this journey of idiocy:
 
**tuesday:**
we all go to the beach at night and obviously no one else is around. my gf is horny, but since this is the first time i've brought a so with me to somewhere public for possible sex, i felt nervous about doing the nasty, so i said tomorrow instead. that night ended with me being tackled into a small fire by my pantless, drunk friend, but that's not too out of the ordinary for us.

**wednesday:** 
we all go to the beach one more time, only this time i decide to take some of that green goody stuff we brought, and when the dirty business was about to happen, i realized i was too high to try to do anything with ao5269 jr. so now i'm left on the beach stoned with an angry, unsatisfied girlfriend, so at this point i'm fucking up royally. i determine tomorrow i will not intake any substance and pleasure my woman! well about that....

**thursday:**
i'm finally going all out for this fucking fuckfest! i set up a towel on the dunes, i have my folks back at my cottage fooled into thinking we're out for the night, and i refuse to take any liquor or weed. hell yeah, i'ma gonna sex my lady up right! so we start the making out session, then comes the removing of the pants part, then we roll a bit but eventually make our way back to that towel. before my slot a could insert in her tab b however, i start to feel an odd poke in my back. i pause for a sec to ponder what is wrong, gf asks what's wrong, and i decide to ignore the weird poke because sex. so we make out a bit and then the fun begins! ""yay!"" i thought, until then that weird poke starts getting deeper and another poke starts up too. at this point, the fun gets put on hold and i ask my patient gf to take a look at my back for me. when the first words out of her mouth when looking at my back were ""now don't panic, but...."" i started to panic for obvious reasons. and then i hear her say that there's a goddamn fish hook in back!!!!! 

i took it well............about as well as a chicken who got decapitated. i start running around screaming yelling ""get it off, get it off!"" for some damn reason my immediate response was to rip off my condom, but i never accused myself of being a genius. soon my shirt comes off and the hooks fly off with it. that's right, you read that right: hooks! plural! upon closer inspection, it was a device that featured nine motherfucking back hating hooks on it!!! [http://image.dhgate.com/albu_227231928_00-1.0x0/3pcs-fishing-hook-new-mine-silver-carp-hooks.jpg] (something similar to this lovely image) my terror filled screams of ""what!?!"" are being match by my supportive gf's maniacal laughter. i go back to my other friends who are wondering who had the death scream. i explain this previously mentioned story, and my old pantless friend from before says ""dude, god is cockblocking you."" that comment sparked me off, after a solid week of no sex, i take my gf, run back to the spot, and fucked every last inch of her. as it turns out, pain and anger make me a sex god. 

afterwards, it became my most popular story, and a running joke broke out among my friends that a whale was trying to catch me and take me for themselves. this evolved to the point where the new running joke was that i fuck whales. this is my legacy to my high school brotheren, and of course it was all due to a frisky fish hook.


 

**edit** i do good grammar.",hooked and hooked up. captain hook would be proud of me.
803,"so this is really a joint fuck up, and perhaps not as horrific as some, but here goes... 

my boyfriend's parents live in wales, where he's staying for the summer, but he was visiting me in london last week. i work weekdays, so he was running errands all day at the flat, while i was working about an hour away. he was due to go back on friday, so we made a plan to meet at around 5pm by my work place so that we could hang out before he went back to wales.

he texted me at around half 1 to say he was just having lunch (he'd made pasta the night before so he was just heating that up on the hob - relevant!). he then left the flat at around 3.30 pm to come and meet me at work. 

we had a lovely evening, and his coach wasn't till 8, so i stayed in london with him till he left. i didn't actually get on the train home till about half 8, so i wasn't home till about half 9. 

it was a pretty hot day, and i was sweltering when i walked in, so i opened all the windows. my flat tends to get very hot when all the windows are closed, so it didn't seem unusual that it felt like a sauna. i started to cough a little too, one of those dry, back-of-the-throat sort of coughs. i put this down to fumes etc from outside, which was later confirmed by my parents.

they rang me soon after i walked in to ask if i was okay, because apparently there was a fire near me (my parents live quite close to me, so they'd obviously seen smoke in the direction of my road and asked someone if they knew what was going on). i had a look out, and couldn't see any smoke, so i told them it must be closer to them and went to investigate. i'm the type to shut all of the windows when i'm out, even for a few minutes, so i went round and made sure everything was shut before leaving. turns out the fire was in one of the flats along the high street, someone had left the gas on and set their place on fire - nasty stuff. 

this fire reminded me of a time in our previous flat, when my boyfriend had left the hob on, and i had come home to a smoke filled flat and burn marks on the wooden surfaces around the oven. likely what happened here, so i texted him and told him about the fire - just making conversation really.

i arrived back at my flat at around quarter past 10, and walked in to a furnace. i couldn't work out why, it wasn't *that* hot now, and i hadn't been out that long. it was a little hazy too, so i checked the oven. nope, all off, so i went round and opened all the windows, figured it was just the fire as it wasn't that far away and smoke travels. 

as i was opening the window above the oven, i felt it. it was definitely hotter here, much hotter. i examined the dials on the side of the hob, and nearly fainted. one of them had been left on high. the one my boyfriend had used to cook his lunch. at half 1 in the afternoon - 9 fucking hours ago.

needless to say i sent him another text along the lines of ""oh my fucking god you left the fucking hob on, it's a fucking good job my place didn't burn down and i actually bothered to fucking check, can you imagine what would've fucking happened if i'd fallen a-fucking-sleep with that on, what the fucking fuck?"" or perhaps something a little more eloquent, i'm not sure.",apparently my flat and someone else's were competing to see who could withstand extreme heat the longest - mine won.**
804,"so... i've had nothing to eat but fast food for the last 3 days... and i hadn't shit in a while. at least 2 days. my farts could peel paint. america could slap a biohazard sticker on me and stick me in their nuclear arsenal is what i'm getting at. just the most rancid smells oozing from my body imaginable. more atrocious than columbine, virginia tech and sandy hook combined... ya feel me?  
  
so, there's this hot chick friend of mine. she wasn't quite a 10 but damn close. she needed some help moving and we've been friends for a long time. 10 years kinda deal. so i help her out. now... remember when i said i hadn't shit in a couple days?  well... scumbag brain waits until i'm in her house and lifting a couch to decide to start inching towards the finish line. right about now i'm balls deep in a staircase with a chick i've known for years, a couch and about 30 degrees(celsius) of musky air and my face just goes as white as a ghost. she looks down at me and asks what's wrong as a small dose of mustard gas is being rocketed out of my quivering anus. i shout ""let's go let's go"" and start shoving the couch up which causes her to lose balance and she drops it. i basically run her over with the thing rather than facing the embarrassment of allowing her to smell that poison. we get the couch out to the truck and i apologize for rushing and blame it on a leg cramp.   
  
now... i'm way to shy to try unload this kind of package at a friends house let alone a girls house. this is world war 3 style chemical warfare we're talking about. zyklon.b looks like laughing gas compared to what i'm packing. i mean.... clogging the toilet with it's circumference while the molten core violently explodes leaving a fecal volcano in it's wake. so there's no stores or restaurants near by and i don't have a good enough reason to leave so while i have a torpedo prairie dogging my cinnamon ring i man the fuck up and keep on working.  
  
about 15 minutes later after the successful bombing of a couple rose bushes with my sour clouds i return to the next item at hand. feeling considerably better after partially deflating the bowels of hell, we grab the dresser. whilst navigating this behemoth of an oak piece of furniture i realized i would have to take the bottom again as it was extremely heavy and it was just the two of us. assuming the position i bend down and lift with all i've got, she makes it about 5 stairs before losing her grip letting go. almost as if in slow motion i feel the dresser pushing me backwards as i lose my balance and fall... as i hit the stairs and wall i feel a tiny warning nugget erupt from mission control, as if to warn all surrounding areas of the impending doom... then i feel it... too focused on trying to land safely i forgot about the oak dresser as it barrels downwards and the edge slams into my guts... what came next is like something out of a horror show...  
  
i mean... there was more shit spattered on the stairs and walls then if someone got shot... i'm almost certain the velocity in which my anal cavity was exhumed broke the sound barrier... diarrhea was everywhere and the more i moved the more came out in a solid stream of just fat ass flaps clapping as the clenching of my butt cheeks was not strong enough to withstand the pressure build up inside my body. it was like an anus orchestra playing my final tune as i'd surely die of embarrassment... note that the entire time this was processing she had begun to projectile vomit from what i can only imagine was the stench of the gas used in nazi concentration camps and the sight of a 350 lb bag of shit that just exploded in her basement. i hosed myself off and left. 

 

note to reader, when i fell backwards the shitty basement stairs ripped an opening in the ass of my pants allowing a clear and un-obstructed path for my biological warfare.

we decided to meet up and see what happened. it was amazing. absolutely awesome. but we both know that nothing will come from it. which is fine. the problem is, i can't do anything with my so without picturing   them instead and it's driving me crazy.","cheated, can't stop thinking about new person when i'm with my so"
806,"i got up late after my 2 year old turned off the alarm.  i could not get my eldest son off to school and he didn't feel well so it worked out alright.  i went back to sleep which is unusual for me.  i normally stay up to make sure my wife gets off to work.  so my wife finally got me up about an hour and half before she has to leave for work.  my eldest needed to replace his eyeglasses and i decided since he was home already, we should do it today.  the initial plan was to get my father in law to take us (my sons and me).  that fell through.  i then tried to get my brother in law to help us.  again, it was a no go.  that should have ended my planning but once i get an idea in my head, i become compulsive.  i need to do it.  my wife should have just told me to go to hell and i would have grumbled for awhile.  but apparently, she loves me and knows how miserable i get when can't do something i think i need to.   so here's where i fucked up her day.  i made the appointment, knowing someone else would come get us later but i don't get things ready quick enough and find shoes for my youngest.  i put him footy pajamas and put clothes over that.  she kept looking for shoes for another five minutes after i got the kids in the car. we finally headed to the eye exam 10 minutes out of the way.  to make matters worse, i couldn't find it.  i called and got directions.  she finally dropped us off.  all the delays caused her to be 15 minutes late and miss her meeting with her supervisor.   that lead to a writeup and will most likely delay her advancement in a company she has been promoted 3 times in her first 6 months.  so effectively, i have destroyed all the hard work she has put in and her chance to get to the next position in next 6 months which she was on track to do.  i feel like shit.","got it in my head my son needed to get an eye exam today, cause my wife to be late for work, get a write up and probably delayed her promotion track."

810,"so i'm a decent sized guy, clocking in at 6', 250 lbs. i'm a developer at a large financial company where full corporate professional attire is required other than a jacket. in the afternoon around 2pm i got up from my desk to stretch due to my post lunch coma. as i squatted down with one leg out my pants split from the top of my ass all the way down to my balls. it wasn't even a clean rip. it was zig zagged and large, the wool just shredded. i sat down at my desk and couldn't stop laughing and my face turned bright red. 

many thoughts came to my head as to how to get the hell outta my office without anyone noticing. trying to staple them, staple them with paper, etc. all solutions would have me either walking across the office where everyone notices my ass hangin out, or wheeling my chair around like a weirdo. as i rummaged through my desk drawers for a solution, i found an alpaca sweater i left over the winter. i wore it around my waste like it was 1985 again and got the fuck outta there.",split my pants ass to balls at work.
811,"this happened a few weeks ago, but i'm still dealing with the aftermath. i have a friend, a good one, who i've known since i was a kid. we're both older now, and more.mature, or so i thought. up until i got into contact with him this past winter, we hadn't spoke since sophomore year or high school, which is 5 years ago. we  were like brothers than, and i just found his number one day, qnd.called him. but back to the fuck up. apparently n the past five years, he became a major racist. not a ""racist,"", a full blown racist. if i had known this, i certainly would not have taken him to hang out with me. my neighborhood is ethnic to say the least, very mixed. this mixed with my ""friends"" new found prejudice made for not only a really bad experience, but almost got us killed a few times. 

first, every time he saw a black person he would turn to me and say ""oh god more of them.."" or ""oh fuck another black guy"". he did this every time we saw an african american, which in my neighborhood is pretty much everywhere. i never even think of it, but he was both prejudice and scared. a few people heard him, and started to walk towards us like they were gonna say something. it didn't help that every two minutes he was spitting, which made it look as though he was spitting at black people. it took me a few minutes to realize he wasn't, but i'm sure those the people around us didnt realize. 

he went on a 20 minute diatribe about how his mother will not allow him to come here because ""there's too many blacks"" and how he hates his neighbor because he's african american. he said all this loudly. while walking around the area he was talking about. 

lastly, he started yelling at cabs and calling them ""gyspy fuckers"" and ""arabs"". of course that wasn't it. they're all part of some large sleeper cell according to him, and we should never trust or speak to anyone of middle eastern descent. 

i didn't know what to do. i just wanted to throw a quick right into his face, but figured i'd be the one to get tossed in jail. i was beyond relieved when he left because i couldn't take another fucking second of it. i rarely speak to him now, and am much better off.

for the past week or so, i have been waxing the cyclops in the shower everyday, using your basic shampoo as a lubricant. so all is good, i'm happy, satisfied, throughout the entire week. 

then i woke up this morning. i was laying in bed, with your basic morning crotch action goin' on. i did the glorious morning stretch, during which i flexed my dick ( or the whole kegal muscle shit). then the tip of my dick exploded in pain, so i was scared. maybe its just me, but unknown genital pain is a red flag in my book.

i ignored it, hoping the pain would disappear. and it did, so i was happy. annnnnddd then i did the whole dick-flex thing again, and my penis felt like it had been shot with a bb gun. "" shit, this matters."" 

reluctantly, i threw myself out of bed, and peeked into my trousers to assess the damage. what i saw was a canyon making a home in the tip of my penis. apparently, the shampoo had dried out only the tip of my dick, with drastic results.

so, the thing at the bottom looks waxy, but feels rough to the touch. my tip is basically white, not like a white guy, but straight up white on a color wheel, with bloody canyons mixed in.

my stomach dropped and i feel nauseous.  i know its been a while and he might have mentioned it by now.  but he's also tech-tarded and i don't know if this pic is a ticking time-bomb laying in wait in his (or his wife's or kids or grandkids) phone/computer's photostream.

817,"i'm european and as it is mandatory to have visited amsterdam (netherlands) at least once while in your twenties, me and two of my best friends decided to go on a trip there over new year's eve.

for those who don't know, amsterdam is besides their liberal policy on soft drugs infamous for its red light district (with hookers dancing in those shopwindow-like cabins and stuff), and it is in fact the place to rock out and where everyone is partying. since me and my friends are not really into smoking weed, we just gotterribly wasted - business as usual so far.

so, despite not having the intention to enter a hooker's cabin originally, there was that one gorgeous redhead, and as she began to wave at me, shit started to get serious. at that time i was in this particular state where the booze started to interfere with my rational thinking and fueling my sexual appetence. i thought ""fuck this"" - literally, told my friends i'm seeing them afterwards and went straight to that fine piece of redhead ass.

after spending one hundred euros for her giving me head and some doggy while standing, she demanded another hundred to move action over to the bed, otherwhise we'd be finished here. despite being drunk i realised where this was going and decided to cut it there instead of being ripped off. so i angrily put my pants back on still fully erected and left the place. i actually wasn't even that mad - i would probably rip off those drunk youngsters too, if i were her.

so i met up my friends again at the bar, told them the amusing story while we proceeded to intoxicate ourselves. this is where the actual funny stuff happened: i went for a piss and stood infront of the urinal, packed out and let go. the feeling of relief was there - but no splashing sound. i lowered my field of view to my privates to check what was going on and almost cracked up when i saw it. i actually never removed the condom and had been wearing it all along since i left that hooker, and now i'm filling it up with piss. when i noticed it had already expanded to about half a litre until it finally stripped itself off my dick due to it's weight and ended up in a splashy explosion. you should have seen that expression of amusement and disbelief from the random guy at the urinal next to me. i left the room not exactly knowing if i should feel ashamed or proud about myself. however i shared a good laugh with my friends about this after i told them - but still feel somehow embarassed.

fast forward half an hour or so, and i realise my butthole is really itchy. this has happened to me a few times before when i haven't wiped enough, and there's still a bit of chocolate around the mouth, but that didn't make any sense since i'd been so thorough.

so i rush back home to the bathroom and wipe some more. i looked at the tissue, as you do, but instead of a brown smudge, i was surprised to see red. since dudes don't get ass-periods i concluded that the sharp toilet paper had cut my butt!

it didn't hurt too bad. to be honest the real pain is the embarrassment that my anus is so much of a wuss that it got cut open by some fucking toilet roll.",my asshole is a pussy**
819,"i really fucked up this time, about two days ago i was having a few afternoon drinks at my house because it was a mates birthday and was going to go clubbing later that night, the four of us that where drinking together finished a carton of beer extremely faster then usual, i decided we had heaps more time to drink before we went clubbing, the problem was that we had no more alcohol and didn't want to walk to buy anymore. my genius of a drunk mind thought it was a good idea to bring my friends down the street to my uncles house who was having dinner at my mother in laws house. the house was empty and he had alot of hard liquor at his house which i remembered so we went in and started drinking there for abit falling over and knocking things around.

my friend left the lounge room and walked towards the toilet and fell over grabbing a urn which was my grandmothers onto the ground and he screams and calls all of us over and we scream, i then vomit all over the ashes and my friends are vomiting through out the house. we cleaned the house up as best we could and haven't told my grandfather what happened with the urn yet.

** 

**edited - a word**","- went to my grandfathers house to steal alcohol, knock and vomit on my grandmothers urn and feel extremely guilty without know one else knowing other then my friends who were there.**"
820,"ok, so technically this happened last night, but this is what happened. i apologise for the tl;dr in advance, i'm a first-time poster.

i was driving home from my mate's house, at around 11:30pm, when this woman walks out in front of my car, sobbing hysterically and begging me to help her. i was initially reluctant because i was cautious, but she did seem genuinely distressed so i asked what she needed (she wouldn't move out from in front of my car and let me pass anyway).

she said she just needed to get to home, which was in a suburb just around the corner. i figured this lady might have really needed some help, so me being the good albeit, naive and stupid samaritan that i am, let her in. within 10 seconds of being in a confined space with her, the stench of booze wafting off her hit me like a sledgehammer. 

i went around the round about at the end of the street and started heading the other way when all of a sudden she starts yanking on my arm (my shifting arm) begging me to pull over! 
at this point i was going at 45kms/hr, and me being the frugal bastard i am, was already sliding it into fifth gear when she yanked it all the way over to first. at that speed, pushing it into first would've fucked up my engine big time, but luckily i slammed down the clutch.

so i stopped, thinking she had to get out and puke or something, and then she starts begging me to buy her some 'ciggies'.
in the pallid, dim glow of the street light above above us, i finally got a proper look at her, witnessing her yellow teeth and needle marks in all their glory, and it dawned on me that this was some junkie bitch.

i told her i had no money, but through force of habit i had foolishly left my wallet under the dash and it had a couple of twenty's sticking out. she saw this, called me a liar and tried to snatch it, but in her inebriated state her hand-eye co-ordination was sorely lacking, so luckily i got to it first. 
she kept begging me to get her some 'ciggies' saying she wouldn't leave until i did. not wanting to part with one of my precious twenty's (i'm a frugal bastard, remember) i gave her all the change i had... which was like 5 bucks, and asked her if that was enough.

she told me she needed $10, and all i had was those 2 twentys. sensing i was reluctant to part with them, she offered to leave her bag in the car as collateral, until she gave me the change. at this point i just wanted to get this crazy bitch out my car, so i gave her $20, she left her bag inside and left.

i actually, stupidly waited for a minute because i wanted the $10 (yes, frugal! to give you some perspective i'm a uni student with a part-time job, i had just gotten a $100 parking fine that day from uni, and both of my parents are out of a job so i am the only one supporting the family atm), but i figured the opportunity cost of her potentially coming back with a bunch of drug dealing pimps, stabbing me, and stealing my car was a price that i wasn't willing to pay.

so i wound down her window and chucked her shit out. i heard a glass bottle of what i can safely assume was booze, shatter inside her bag and then i sped off into the night.

karma must be wasted, why else would my good deeds be reciprocated by horse shit? go home, karma... you're drunker than that junkie bitch i picked up.

so just wrapping up, i'm not 100% sure i wouldn't do the same thing if the same scenario arose. as in, a person who genuinely needed help, not some junkie whore. what would you guys do in that situation?

 
p.s: if you actually read the whole thing, thank you, and sorry for putting you through that borefest.",i picked up a hitchhiker who i thought was in genuine trouble. turned out she was a junkie and she technically robbed me. tifu.

822,"when i reached into my drawer of sex paraphernalia for my tube of astroglide, i was quite disappointed to come to the realization that i had extinguished said tube and failed to replenish my supply. while there, however, i noticed a tube of ky warming gel i bought to try with a particular lady friend that i told to take a hike before we got around to using it. i grabbed the tube and thought 'what the hell...' i tested it on me first, applying it liberally to my ""intimate area"" and delaying with some foreplay to give the stuff time to work. it didn't seem to have much of a warming sensation for me, so i declared all systems go and immediately set sail. it's probably about 90 seconds later that she's in my bathroom shouting ""it won't stop burning"" and climbing into my shower. being the caring, sensitive guy that i am, i'm caught somewhere between 'yeah, i guess it makes sense the stuff would react differently *inside* her than it would *on* me' and 'i'm pretty sure this is what the stuff was meant for, so i'm sure she won't actually be hurt by this' which yielded a response of ""haha, sorry about that, hahaha."" i used to think i was just an asshole as a security measure against the general public, because i don't like most of you flesh bags most of the time, but now i think i'm really just a genuine asshole, and i've just chemically burned her's.","used the stuff, things got hot, definitely some sex she'll never forget. a+"
823,"this actually happened a about a year ago, but its always a good laugh. i've been trying to climb the restaurant ladder for about a year at that time the traditional way (start as a dishwasher and learn hands-on). i had already learned a lot, and also being a bit of a narcissist prick, i loved to show off my new-found culinary chops to my layman friends. 

so we had planned a barbecue one night and i had been drinking a fair amount. eager to assert my perceived mastery of the kitchen, i offered (i.e. demanded) to be allowed to prepare the whole spread. my friends agreed. and so, i self-styled master chef, set to work. i began with the mashed potatoes first; dicing each spud into easy to boil cubes. this procedure had the additional benefit of showing off what i thought were my ninja-like knife skills. i began to carry on a conversation with one of my buddies (who was in another room) and began to focus less on the razor-sharp hunk of steel i was irresponsibly wielding. until i felt a sharp pain shoot up from my left thumb. apparently while talking, i continued dicing and had added the tip of the digit to the potatoes for that extra kick. the cutting board was covered in an astounding amount of jack daniels ridden blood, and there on the board was the piece of the thumb, complete with a tiny clipping of the nail. shit. i mopped the blood up the best i could and slipped into the bathroom to patch myself up. i left the thumb-tip on the cutting board. 

by the time i staunched the bleeding, i found that someone had finished cooking for me. the alienated piece of flesh was no where to be found. later on, however, somebody did encounter the nail clipping in the potatoes...",i drunkenly attempted to make mashed potatoes and succeeded only in amputating the tip of my thumb; which was later mixed into the finished product.
824,"i work part time as a cashier. last night it was becoming increasingly slow in the store and i was becoming increasingly lazier. at around 7:30, i was helping a customer when they requested a bag. as i take one off the rack, i feel a tickle on my nose and feel a sneeze coming on. i decide to itch my nose with my shoulder, and as i do, fan out the bag with my hands to open it. because of this quick action, my shoulder decides to jump up directly into my nose, more or less punching myself in the face. there was blood everywhere on me, the didn't let me go home.","helping a customer results in me punching myself in the face, kinda."
825,"so here i am, trying to recover from the funky funks and enjoying a wonderful cocktail of chicken broth and garlic croutons watching alaskans yell at each other about gold. after my one and only meal of the day, i'm chilling in my fortress of funk (my bed), i felt a little rumbbly in the tumbbly. 

i've always heard the axiom of ""never trust a fart when you have the flu"", but i ignored the facts and experiences from my past fallen comrades. oh, what a fool i was! i leaned over, expecting a minor squeeker at best, and the torrent of vile putridity that flowed freely from my backside will forever haunt me...

826,"it was so ridiculous that i still don't quite know what to think about it. i was taking the sat, doing well, confident in the essay that i wrote, yada yada. well, we went out for break and per the proctors instruction, i slipped my answer packet into the test booklet. i slipped it in to section 3 because, well, that was the next section and i was just kind of on autopilot because i was stressed about doing my best. 

we get back from break and the proctor instructs us to open up our answer packets and, if you haven't taken the sat, there's a part where you need to write in script about how 'this is your work and no one elses'. so, i flip open to the answer packet and i'm doing my best to remember how to do cursive. as i'm writing, the proctor says in a stern voice ""excuse me, is your test book open?"" i realize she's talking to me. i apologize profusely, trying to explain myself, but she's having none of it. i close the test booklet and tell myself to get my act together and pay attention. 

i was shaking from her yelling out to me. i simply was under so much stress that i was having a hard time processing it. trying to calm myself down and finish with the cursive, i heard the proctor say 'section 3'. i assumed we were starting section 3, so in my autopilot mode i flip it open again. the proctor lost it, wondering 'how stupid' i could be. i was honestly wondering the same thing, too. there was another kid who didn't understand as well, and she both reported us to her supervisor. the supervisor informed us that our scores would most likely be canceled because we could've been cheating. 

i finished section 3, excused myself, and canceled my scores. i signed myself up for the december one, but if i mess up on that one then i can't go to college. so basically because i was so nervous, stressed out, and auto pilot about doing well, i did the exact opposite.","wasn't paying attention. had the test booklet open when i wasn't supposed to, accused of cheating, had to cancel the scores of a test i've been studying a good amount for."
827,"i never thought i'd fucking say this. but now my innocent mind is scarred

i was sitting in the living room with my puppy, watching some sunday morning talk show. she's sitting there, gnawing on her bone, when suddenly the television begins blaring. i freak out, thinking she was actually chewing on the remote and i frantically run over to her. she's confused because the television is so loud and i'm running around looking for the remote. 

i think, somehow, that my parents, in their room (yea, i'm 23 and live at home. cheap rent ftw), have the wrong remote. i knock on their door and open it, yelling ""where it's the remote!!"" over the fucking insanely loud commercials--especially since we all know commercials get three times louder than the actual show.

yep. my dad is on top of my mom. i shut the door, and still search for the remote, but now i'm shaking. ""it'll be okay, it's not that big of a deal"" i tell myself. if only i knew what i'd feel like when the adrenaline left

828,"tifu.

i met this very hot guy (nb. i'm also a guy) at the club. a gorgeous 6"" australian flight attendant.  we really got along well - too well, perhaps.  i didn't realise the time until he checked his watch and said it was 3.40am.

we decide to go back to the hotel that his employer had rented for him - a really nice place in the centre of town.  sexy times ensue.

it's a classy hotel, too. great views of the river; linen that you're tempted to steel. 

we're sleeping it off and... i have this incredibly vivid dream that i need to pee terribly. in my dream i am trying so hard to find the bathroom.

and then i woke up.

completely naked, in the hotel hallway.  my dream was correct - i definitely was in dire need of the bathroom.  unfortunately, i could not remember for the life of me which hotel room i had stumbled out of.

incredibly confused, freaking out, and naked, i go from door to door trying all the handles hoping that the relevant room is unlocked.

after trying about 15 rooms, finally! success! the door opens!

except... it's the wrong room.  i make eye contact with a business man doing up his tie - my head poking around the door he was not aware of my predicament - and mutter a ""sorrywrongroom"" apology.

i retire to the garbage shoot to evaluate the situation.  what am i supposed to do?

finally, i hear another door open.  i decide there's nothing for it.  hand-on-crotch, i step out and say, ""excuse me.""  i explain my predicament and they provide me with a towel and telephone reception.

the receptionist was an absolute doll. i tell her, ""this was a total one night stand.  i have no idea what his name was.  all i know is that he works for an airline and his hotel booking is for several weeks.""

this was enough to narrow it down to two rooms on that level (hoping i hadn't managed the lift while asleep).

we try the first option and - success - i see my pants in the corner.  i signal to the receptionist *we did it* and she gives me the thumbs up.

she leans over and whispers in my ear, ""his name's dean"" before closing the door.

i peed, slipped back into bed and never mentioned a word of my fuck up to my host.

edit for extra detail: i relieved myself down the hotel garbage shoot. i lied when i said i did it after i was allowed entry into the hotel room because i was actually too embarrassed to admit it to reddit.",don't forget your towel
829,"ill start out by saying that my brother and i have a pretty retarded sense of humour ever since watching its always sunny in philadelphia...

anyway, we could hear our neighbours out in the front yard, and we get along with them pretty well so we decided to do something funny as fuck.

my brother revved our piece of shit 50cc scooter to like 60ks an hour in the back yard and went flying out the garage door with no helmet, closely followed by me piss bolting after him, wielding a machete yelling ""ill cut you cunt, dont steal my scooter you fucking rat...."" all the way up the street. i stop running because im laughing so hard and casually walk back down the street to my house holding a machete, this is when i spot some brunette stunner getting the keys to the house next door from my neighbours while they all look at me so fucking puzzled and weirded out.

my brother comes back thru the garage like a minute later and we both lose it laughing not realising that she was house sitting for a week.

at dinner, dad comes in and tells me the whole story of how she is 21, single, and house sitting for the week and apparently really nice which is when i realise that even if i were to throw a basketball over the fence ""accidentally"" so i can go over, she probably wont even open the front door.",chase brother down the street with a machete in an elaborate joke to the horror of the hot brunette house sitting next door. and my dad has more game than me hahahahaha

i see a customer drop a 2 litter of sprite off a five foot rack. 

i could have been sharp and quickly exchanged the 2 liter. but there was a line and i was in the middle of a transaction. 

so this guy has like 5 bottles in his hands and i am almost done ringing up a fine early fourty's dame. she is rocking a top notch deep red wool coat and a long fashionable fall dress.

i see captain awkward try to place his booze and shaken up 2 liter on the counter and erhh mah gawd i see him start to fumble.

the 2 liter somehow, out of an act from god, lands between the dames legs.

834,"okay, a bit of backstory, both my friend and i need to get out of our houses. my mother is running me broke (and i can't say no, or i'll be homeless), and her mom is causing her to have stress-related seizures.

so, while talking...well, ranting to her a few months ago, i was saying that i was looking for an apartment, and she told me that she wanted to come with, and split the rent. but neither of us had a job, which would help with nothing. after a while, i got an overnight job at a walmart, stocking the shelves and making a decent $9.65 an hour. i decided to help my friend get a job there, but knowing her, her people skills are lacking, allowing her to fail the application assessment (she answered honestly, like...you don't do that). during the 60 days she had to wait, we applied to a target that was newly opened. they called today, and after a bit of pleading, i convinced them to give her a call. this is how it went down (she was on speaker).

**target human personnel**: hi! is this mr_mech's friend i'm speaking with i'm speaking with?

**friend**: yes, this is her.

**thp**: well, your friend mr_mech wanted us to call you, so that we could hopefully get an interview. may i ask what position you're applying for?

**friend**: stocker...without customers.

**me** (storming of to another room): oh my god you stupid bitch.

**thp**: oh...well, we'll see if we can pencil you in, we'll contact you by mail or phone call, letting you know if we have anything.

**friend** (sounding dejected): okay, thanks for the call.

okay, maybe i shouldn't have yelled that she was a stupid bitch, but it was my fault for continuously telling her that i'd put her in the back room to avoid customers, it turns out that she doesn't think when she's under pressure, so i'm currently teaching her how to lie to get a job. luckily for her, she was able to reapply to walmart, and i took the app assessment, so she's clear on that one, my manager is aware of her antics, so she should be good for the job.","helped my friend get a job, she fucked up because i fucked up and filled her head with bad thoughts."

it's finals week so the campus was practically empty.  i head into the mens room and discover two stalls-- one was occupied.  i got a little nervous because i'm 'gun shy', so to speak, but being a grown man, i went in and sat down.

the other guy must have been poo shy too because it was silent for a few minutes.  i finally became relaxed enough to do my thing, and it went well, so now it was time to wipe.  

...the bathroom was silent so i knew when i started wiping the stranger would hear it.  not only that but he would know exactly what that sound was.  cue panic attack.  

i tried to time the wipe with the toilet flushing but there was a problem with the motion sensor so i had to hit this button with the same hand i was wiping with because the other hand was holding my shirt out of the way of my ass.  the flush didn't last very long, and before i knew it i was in ""abort mission"" mode- pulled up my pants and gtfo.

838,"this happened the other night while driving to meet up with my friends for a night of hookah and cards against humanity.

so, backstory. i drive an '89 cherokee, and given my 6'3"" stature, the extreme left side of the windshield is a bit difficult to see out of some times. on top of that, i live in a fairly mountainous area and the pine trees have been dumping their pollen all over everything (i actually saw a pollen-devil the other day when it was hot). i don't normally have issues with a dirty windshield, but it's been pretty bad lately. i keep putting off washing the car because i have other more important things to do (like studying for finals).

so anyway, it's been a long day of work and school (working at a plant nursery around mother's day is pretty brutal), and i'm going to hang out with my friends in the downtown area of the large city that's down the mountain, so to speak. i'm cruising along, not thinking much of my dirty windshield beyond a little added glare. i get to the left turn i need to make, no cars are around, so i just go for it. being tired, i completely forgot that there might be pedestrians. lo and behold, there was, and he just so happened to be at such a spot that i couldn't see him until after i got into the turn. 

my car handles relatively well and so i was still doing a solid 15mph around the corner. cue my sudden vision of the poor guy. i slam on my brakes and swerve to the right, and he does a little dance and makes it out of the way. he was close enough that he actually reached out and leaned on my hood in his efforts to get away. of course i was fucking terrified, and i almost crawled out of my window during my profuse apologies. he gave me a look that was half terror/adrenaline and half ""what the fuck were you doing?"" and goes on his way. i'm just glad i didn't pull a ""are you fucking sorry?!""

 

on the bright side, once i arrived i was surprised with one of my very best friends who i hadn't seen in 6 months. just about hugged her to death.","forgot to wash my windshield. dirt/pollen and late-night streetlight glare made it so i didn't see a pedestrian until too late. terror was had all around, but no injuries. i am a fucking idiot."

i try and resist the temptation of sleep for as long as i can, and as a result, those annoying as fuck sleepy boners come flying in, i managed to hide most of them well, looking busy at my desk, but then my manager was changing a light bulb, and me being a fairly tall gentleman, was drafted into helping her out. you can guess where this is going, cue the most awkward sleepy boner around. luckily no one noticed.. that is until my manager backed up against me and felt it with her hip.

she takes one look down, and looks at me and says, ""i don't think this role is suitable for you."" tells me to pack my stuff up and leave.

841,"the other day i was out running errands on my lunch hour. it was our first really hot day, 90+, and i'm a big guy. also i should say i was in a convertible with the top down. so i get some taco bell and a large diet dew in the midst of my errands. mind you i have been sucking down diet dew all day and peed a couple of times already. finally i'm getting firmly middle aged and the prostrate is not what is used to be.

so, i'm on my final errand. i'm at the post office mailing the results of my previous efforts. and i get the urge to pee really bad. of course there's no bathroom available here. a little pee sneaks out. ""shit!"" i think, but maybe that will relieve some pressure. nope. it's only getting worse.

i'm standing in front of the robo postal thing buying postage and bouncing up and down. a little more squirts out. i still think i'm safe. the undies will catch it. all i need to do now is seal and mail the damn letters (when will we be able to attach physical objects to e-mail? google are you listening?). suddenly the dam bursts. piss is running down my legs, my pants are soaked, i'm mortified.

i look around, no one has noticed. good. fortunately i parked close. i have maybe 100 feet to my car to hide in. i head for the door. i go out the wrong way. a woman comes in right as i'm in her path. i twist out of her way and turn my dry behind to her. if she see she says nothing. i think i'm home free, nope. there's a second woman right behind the first. i try to turn again, but i can't since i'm at the door by now. again if she sees, she's kind enough not to say anything. i make it safely to my car.

i call off work for the rest of the day, shower change and try to forget.","too much dew, pissed myself at the post officce"
842,"didn't think i'd be back here so soon... this happened 2 days ago. 

i head over to my friends house around the time he gets off of work was going to surprise him with some beers and a blunt to smoke, i get there before him and notice nobody is home at his house? weird but whatever i go inside as usual no big deal, decide to smoke some weed on the upstairs balcony while i'm waiting. i hear a car pull up, figure its my friend and i decide i'm going to scare the shit out of him. i'm stoned and imagining the possibilities before deciding to just jump out of the hallway closet and startle him. 

i'm waiting... and waiting... finally i hear 2 sets of footsteps and girl voices and realize its his sisters getting home from swim practice. no matter i'm going to scare the shit out of these girls, going to be awesome. i wait for the perfect moment, just as they walk by the door, i spring out behind them yelling 'don't move!!' 

the older one just doesnt even turn around to look just screams and runs, the younger one goes laura croft on my ass... spins around and punches me in my fuckin eye! a solid punch too i was more surprised than anything, of course we laughed it off. she felt really bad.

here's where i fuck up, i let her take a picture of my black eye and now everyone knows i got a beat down from a 15 year old. i'm 19.","- got put in my place by a 15 year old girl, whole town knows."
843,"so today i fucked up my hands bad. i was in my or less a heated argument with my brother. i supposedly have some crazy eye, according to my brother, i get when i am beyond angry. i mean uncontrollable and violent. some thing was said to the effect if you hurt me i will choke you out. i am half his size and i love him he is my brother. i don't want to wrestle with him, last time he broke at least two of my ribs. it hurt for weeks. 

so when he stood up and kept saying what i heard ""i'll choke you out"" i grabbed the first two things i saw which were glass half liter bottle. one was thick clear glass and the other was a dark medicine bottle tempered glass. i only meant to bang them against each other hard enough to clank and me say like back off man.  but alas my dumb ass self bangs them so hard against each other that the brown bottle explodes like a rupert drop. it hand my hands bloody immediately but i didn't end up with any serious wounds and my brother well.... he backed off. =) and we resolved the argument. i hate politics.",smash glass bottle on another bottle with my hands glass exploded and messed my hands up but not too severely.
844,"tonight i fucked over myself. i was just getting ready to fall asleep when i thought it might be a good idea to have some white noise on to help me. so i locate my phone, and turn on pandora, i really only use pandora on my phone for this reason so it was already on a good station for my goal. (""ludo"" for the record)

i thought all was well till i noticed the song playing, a song talking about going back in time to spend more time with a loved one who you didn't get to say good bye to. my mind started to wonder in the lyrics, as i do with most songs. finding it's way to the story inbeded in the e.p. the song was found of. the story is one of a guy who loses his wife/girlfriend in a car crash, builds a time machine, goes back in time to fight off dinosaurs, mother nature, dragons, zombies, etc. all in hopes that he can just die in the car with the woman he loved. 

well that story turned my mind to start thinking about my dad, who was murdered in august of last year. and how i will never get the chance to spend more time with him, or joke around with him. then how it's not just me who won't get this chance but anyone. and though i'm normally able to cope with it i find myself just unable to wrap my mind around that idea, even though it's been almost a year and a half i just can't seem to accept it right now....","i put on pandora, depressing song came on and made me depressed about my dad being killed and me not being able to talk to him any more."
845,"it turns out nobody on reddit understands sarcasm, even when it's blatantly obvious. they always just think you're too stupid to be sarcastic. this incident was about military time, but it happens a lot more often then you'd think. so just a quick tifu: tried to be funny to an audience that's too high and mighty for comedy. so fuck you reddit. fuck all of you. fucking dickbags.",could have made a rage comic for sweet sweet karma.
846,"it all starts out on a normal day. i'm running late for school, and i'm in a hurry. as i barge out of the door, i realize that i have forgotten my keys and that without them i'd have no way inside my house because my father would be at work. i head back in a rush and absentmindedly grab a pair of keys from the windowsill and head out. while halfway to the bus stop, my father calls me and tells me i have forgotten my keys. now, at this point i totally forgot that i had went back in to take keys, so i just went back home and grabbed my house keys and ran off to the bus stop just making the bus. ten minutes go by, and i reach into my pocket for a piece of gum. confused, i pull out my father's car keys. ""oh, fuck."" i think. but no problem, because we have two cars and he can take the other one, right? wrong. the car to which keys i accidentally took when i ran back into the house the first time were the car keys, my dad later gave me my own keys. that car was blocking the second car in the drive. my dad shows up to work two hours late, gets humiliated by his supervisor, and almost fired. luckily, he was given a first warning because he never shows up late. 

 

edit: some people are getting confused by my story. my dad works in a hospital and there is no excuse for being late unless it's something like a car accident, death in family, etc. mostly everything has to be called in for. my dad works in the emergency room department so they always need people to be working.","brought dad's car keys to school, almost got him fired."
847,"so i have a friend delivers at this place asked me to cover for him, me being the broke jobless high school kid i leap at the opportunity. even though my car's in the shop, i borrow my dad's in order to work. go in midday, slow only 2 deliveries, then the third one comes. the third delivery's alil heavy, and wet on the bottom, but i think nothing of it, have delivered before and it wasn't that heavy or wet.  i get to the place, i pick it up, and the bottom collapsed right above my middle console. the soups all explode getting fucking everywhere. my cup holders became won ton baths for my phone. the seats are like cloth fiber and take some too, it seeps through other parts of the console. so now my dad's new dodge dart is probably going to smell of shitty wok for the rest of its life.",god of japan smites me with an attack of shitty wok all over the inside of my car.
848,"my boyfriend and i had been hanging out, and we were starting to get very affectionate - in a way that remaining outside was probably going to get us some trouble. instead of stopping, he suggested that we go to his brother's house. keeping in mind that his brother and sister-in-law were moving out and the doors were locked with the keys inside. it sounded like a great idea, so that's what we did. for the last month or so we've been waiting for an opportunity to shower together, and with the water still on in the locked and mostly empty house, we jumped on it. i felt a little paranoid about it, but let it slide. we had to make it fairly quick, as my dad was coming to get me within fifteen minutes - we're still in high school, fyi.

so we start going at it, and i hear the front door slam open (which is the only way to open it when it's locked). i tell him, and quickly turn off the water. turns out his sister-in-law was coming to switch some laundry over. he hops out and quickly gets dressed to explain what we're doing there while i dry off and put my own clothes back on. and by explain, i mean tell the excuse we'd come up with for in case my dad asked why my hair was wet or if we got caught. went home, story worked like a charm. with ""alice"".... not so much, apparently. she knows, and just told us to not mention the incident to his brother and that she wouldn't say anything.","almost got caught in the shower with my boyfriend, and his sister-in-law knows what happened."
849,"so i was on a job site today, moving around materials with a pump-cart.  so anyway, i came to a ramp and i had to get the cart down it.


i'm a guy who has never really been on a job site prior to the week i've been on this one.  i'm not really savvy with anything handyman-ish, and i definitely under appreciated the weight of the wood on my cart.  i've used a pump cart before, but for some reason i thought this one defied the laws of gravity.  so i had probably close to two hundred pounds of wood on a pallet, and i didn't want it to go careening down the ramp and hurt someone potentially, so i thought i would go in front of it and ease it down the ramp.  bad thought.


the cart picked up momentum about a quarter of the way down the ramp and i knew it was going to take me with it, so i jumped out of the way.  but unfortunately for me, i knocked the steering apparatus while jumping out of the way and the cart turned right toward me.  the only place my foot had to go, was right into the concrete on the other side.  i think i piece of metal from the cart is what punctured my foot.


thankfully, only muscle damage.  no tendon damage, no broken bones, and didn't tear the artery near my ankle.

850,"so i just finished school up (i'm on the quarter system) and came back home. yesterday my cousin hit me up to go to the bars with him. seeing as i recently graduated, people kept buying me drinks. i got sloshed. well this one hot girl starts flirting with me, and telling me i'm cute. we start to talk, and she tells me she owns a furniture store in downtown. then she tells me we can check it out later. we talk for a little while longer at the bar, and then we leave for her furniture store. however, she insists i buy beer at the 7-11 next to her place. we go into the furniture shop, and proceed to drink beers. i wake up in the morning to discover i pissed myself on one of her show room couches. i tell her i have to get going, and booked it out of there. no number, no info, just scrammed.","i met a hot girl while drunk, and proceeded to pee on her furniture store's floor couch in my sleep."
851,"wow, this subreddit is already making me feel better. i just went to google and typed in 'i fucked up' on a whim, because i did, and now here i am!

i have been in this apartment for two years now. when i moved in, the owners lived nearby. it is a 'no pets' lane of apartments but there was cat food we had to clean out from under the oven when i moved in, and cats further down the row of apartments, so about six months in i asked if i could get a cat. they said okay, so i got a signed paper from them to send to the local adoption agency ('local' meaning two hours away) and got myself a ridiculously spoiled indoor-only cat. 

since then, the apartment row has been transferred to the management of a faceless corporation that is four hours away in the next major city. the owners moved to florida, i believe.

i let the place get really messy because i am a slob and a bachelorette and i never have anyone over. i got a citation about a month ago telling me i had two weeks to clean the fuck up, so i did. got rid of trash, cleaned out the fridge, vacuumed, washed walls and floors, the whole deal. and i made sure it stayed that way. they came back to inspect, found it good, said so, and left.

now, however, i got a second citation, telling me i have an unauthorized animal on the premises that is making a mess and causing damage. (scratched screen, bent blinds). i have until this friday to get rid of him, or they will 'take action' and i will be liable for damages.

i have no idea what to do. i'm trying to get ahold of the shelter to see if they can get me a copy of the original letter of permission. if not, i think the shelter's provision is that they will take the animal back. i live in an incredibly rural area and there are almost no other apartments that will allow pets. especially now that i've gotten in trouble for making a mess, i'm not even sure if they'd let me in. i have no idea what kind of damages they're claiming, or if they'll let me keep this cat. i've cleaned up my act, the apartment is nice and has been since they inspected, but i'm not sure if they'll back down.

i live literally a thousand miles away from the rest of my family. i moved out here for this job. i don't even know how long i'll have it. this cat is my buddy and i have had him without problems for a year and a half. if i have to return him it is incredibly abrupt, and i don't know what i'll do except maybe stay indoors and cry all summer. i don't care if i'm fucking 28; he's my fucking cat.",i let my apartment become a mess and they had to inspect; despite me cleaning up now i'm being told to get rid of my cat or else.
852,"last year i lost a bunch of weight, and like most- this year i'm well on the way to gaining it back. in an effort to lose the 25 lbs that i gained, i decided to start the same regimen i did last year by going on a several mike long walk/jog in my toe shoes. 6 miles in i notice that one of my toes starts to hurt and so i turn around and jog the 6 miles back, checking my toe for damage when i get home. it's fine, not even raw. so imagine to my surprise when i look down today, 4 days later, and see the biggest blister i've ever seen sprouting from my middle toe. being a dumb college kid, i find my fiance's dull pocket knife and go at it. nothing but blood and thick yellow goo. i'm now sitting at the urgent care getting it stitched up (it was under all the skin and they had to remove some, then sew) about to go on antibiotics.
i will burn the shoes when i get home.","running in old, ""good for you natural"" shoes caused a massive infected blister that has to be stitched up."

854,"so my boyfriend and i are getting ready to lay down and he tells me to make the bed. (because i move around a lot in my sleep and mess up the bedding.) the lights are already off and i go to make the bed. as i am moving the covers around, i notice what looks like a small box, a small ring box. my heart stops, and he says ""what is that?"" i'm all ""i don't know..."" and i pick it up, full of emotions, about to cry. ...it's the charging port to his phone charger. apparently he thought i was going to propose to him too because he really didn't know what it was. i'm an idiot.",i mistook a phone charging port for an engagement ring box and got emotional for nothing.
855,"so today i was in costco buying supplies for a family party i was to attend later in the day. i passed by the tyre section of the shop and noticed a beautifully presented case of windscreen wipers. they were good quality ones, bridgestone, compared to the worn 'imported' ebay ones currently on my car. my current ones were ok, they were a bit noisy but i had no reason to change. i figured i could put something decent on her for once and splurged the £13 ($35) for a set of two. 
i got her home and figured i would fit them right away! this is the point when i remember that life isn't fair and no matter what youre doing you'll be able to find a way to fuck it up. so, the first wiper went on no issue.  i began on the second. it was a bit more difficult to get off but i got there in the end.
i left to get the new wiper. 
there was a light breeze of wind. 
the wiper arm fell back down. 
my windscreen smashed. 

yeah her £13 upgrade turned into an £80 new windscreen. 

the wipers suck too.",;  don't let gremlins near your car.
856,"^^there ^^will ^^be ^^a ^^tldr ^^at ^^the ^^bottom ^^^^teehee

i love my ass. it's a ton of fun to play with. you put things in, you take things out, this makes your 'me' time is so much better. as a guy, it's the only way to get in touch with your inner self and i think it's fascinating to say the least.

but today, this was the reason i was mentally preparing a makeshift will. i'm only 18 and i pretty much have nothing to do all day unless i'm working. obviously if you have the house to yourself, you start to get creative with what you jerk to/with/how. living at home still trying to get to school or something, i work odd hours. today i was going to be working 1:30 to 10:00.

i felt particularly kinky today and decided that i wanted to test my colon's absorption ability.

i've gotten drunk once before, and had a beer or two maybe six other times. i clearly don't know how my body handles alcohol very well, let alone unfiltered anus liquor.

but this doesn't cross my mind. i just want to get a bit of a buzz this morning.

warning: unfiltered ass play ahead
-------------

10:30a i have my shot of vodka in one of those tiny rum bottles and a straw.

i know my plan: create fart, insert bottle and swap fart for shot.

but things aren't perfect. the straw is tearing my asshole a new asshole. it's not that bad though, so i just tough the initial pain out and bend over on my knees and let gravity pull some air in.

then i replace my straw for the bottle while standing and get back on my knees. watching my reflection in our full length mirror i shove my ass almost perpendicular to the floor and both legs spread to see the view. i relax my abs and suddenly the bottle is now empty.

wow. i feel nothing. i expected a little bit of a tingle or burn, but there's nothing. that is, until i take the bottle out. my anus seems to be the only thing that realises what a bad idea this is and screams a signal of pain on contact with the alcohol. not cool. but whatever; i'm just gonna let the rest of it get absorbed so it won't touch my anus any more! foolishly i want to jerk something fierce. a small shampoo thing gets to spend quality time with me. in it goes and off i get.

unfortunately it slips out and a splash of anus burning liquid follows before i clamp shut. it burns. that's not good. ^^oh. this probably wasn't a great idea. [i'm out.](http://cdn.chud.com/1/1f/295x221px-ll-1f759989_jerry-seinfeld-leaving1.gif)

i'm getting to the toilet and feel the pressure of the leftover makeshift fart coming on. apparently i took in more air than i thought.

do you remember the burning of diarrhoea? only having a shot worth of this is fantastic, because every drip leaving feels like letting satan poke my pink. followed immediately after is a 20 second fart that feels like heaven. but all is not well in colon town. head office has noticed a disturbance. an off balance. some huge negative feedback loop starts the process of removing this foreign substance from my digestive tract, and starts doing some natural laxative shit to me.

now i'm feeling waves of discomfort as my bowels rustle and shimmy shit at breakneck speeds to the throne. i'm now a hot mess of shit, vodka, and worry.

but the first wave is over and i'm feeling a little off but okay. so i lay down and rest a bit and think about what i've done.

my mind jumps to the idea of liver failure and within seconds i'm googling the symptoms. but i'm pretty much okay. i rest until i'm ready to go to work and for at least another 30 minutes i'm okay.

but the shits start again when i get to work. more gurgles and stuff make me run for the toilet every little while. i also started feeling a bit bloated, making me think that my liver was backing up and being problematic.

to make a long story shorter, a super fart after many mucusy damaged anus poops made me feel on top of the world. for the four hours there, though, i was certain i shocked my liver to failure or something.

never doing that again.

 
i like my butt so i put vodka in my butt. my butt didn't like that and shot it and everything in my poop tubes straight out. i started convincing myself that i triggered super fast acute liver failure and was just waiting for jaundice to be my tell tale doctors trip note. let a fart out hours later and i'm not dead.",---------
857,"last weekend, i came home because my parents live in the same town that i go to college. well, i knew it was gonna be bad because i had started having stomach problems saturday morning. i started feeling sweaty and uncomfortable with slight bubbly feelings, and as these are the normal symptoms for me when i start getting sick, i just knew. i knew it was going to be awful, because i never get sick with mild things.

easter arrives. i estimate i have a fever of 100, but i haven't bothered to do anything but take some acetaminophen because i have to go through my little sister's baptism. it's one of those new-age churches, you know, wear jeans and t-shirts and there's a band that plays. close to the end of service, my mom says ""we're going to go to lunch afterwards."" and i cut her off with a half-groaned ""no."" by this point, i was clenching every abdominal muscle i could to not puke in this rather nice looking church. i did not need an exorcism. this was at noon.

we get home, my sister stays home with me because she just doesn't want to go. around three o'clock, she orders pizza. hawaiian. my favorite. i figured, i haven't eaten anything all day, i should try a slice. it was a small pizza anyway, so the slices weren't huge. i had two. retreat upstairs, stomach's acting up. lay down for an hour or so. wake up, feel like i have a fart i can't trust. run to toilet. nothing happens. get up, about to pull pants up-boom. vomit's coming. turn 180 degrees to the closest-and-not-urine-filled receptacle: the tub. about five heaves later, there are two slices of pizza in the tub, with identifiable parts. pineapple, ham, some cheese. my thought was ""did i really just not chew?""

anyway, i pretty much just shut down, and get locked into bed because i can't move. next morning i wake up to go back to campus for class, and just before we leave i'm napping on the sofa. wake up. gotta fart. i shouldn't have trusted it. ran to the bathroom, eject out of pants. it's just everywhere. so i soak the underwear, and call out-""my laundry is out there-can i have some underwear and jeans, please?"" my mom's boyfriend brings them to me, and my shame has no fucking limits at this point. i clean my underwear out with hot water and soap, wash my hands, clean out the sink with bleach,  and we leave. but that's not all. 

on the way, i make him pull over less than a mile from my campus because i have to heave on the side of the road. i ended up skipping about 3 or 4 classes this week because i was too scared i would have another incident, and didn't even eat a full meal until tuesday night.

oh, and i infected my oldest sister with it while i was there.","i brought a virus to my mom's house, shit my pants, clogged a tub with pizza, infected my sister, and made my mom's boyfriend late for work.**"
858,"to clarify this happened in 2006-ish on my first ever trip on an airplane

i was sitting in my seat with my mom when i felt the urgent need to pee.  i get the green light from my mom to go because we could finally take our seatbelts off and because this was my first trip i didnt want to fuck up (but boy did i!) i get up and make my way to the bathroom and lock the door behind me, i proceed to unzip my pants and let out the pee i'd been holding in for so long when suddenly the whole bathroom shakes from the plane hitting some 'unexpected' turbulence which sent my urine everywhere, the wall, my trousers, my brand new shirt, and all over the floor. i panicked and backed out of the stall and nearly bumped into the window and calmly and inconspicuously walk over to my seat, reeking in urine. i take a look behind me to see an air hostess standing in my urine because when she opened the door due to some complaint by another passenger all my pee leaked out onto her brand new and rather expensive looking shoes. i kept quiet the whole way and covered myself as much as possible when she came to give me my food...",tried to pee in an airplane and managed to spill it everywhere and on the air hostess' shoes
859,"i don't even know if i'm posting this is the right place, but i feel so shit (excuse my language) right now, so i just want to get it off my chest, and get a bit of advice.

basically, long story short, i met a girl a while back, and we decided to keep in contact over facebook, because she lives a little way away from me. (not too far, but definitely not walking distance) we eventually got to know each other quite well.

so, we chatted for a while, and i asked her out, except i didn't know she had a boyfriend, until she told me, but she said we could still be friends. (friendzoned, i know, but i didn't really mind)

so after a while, we decided to meet up (as friends, nothing else, i'm not that type of person). we did it earlier today, and just went to town and hung out for an hour or two, but i noticed it was incredibly uncomfortable, tense and frosty

she told me after she felt bad, because she was with someone, and it didn't feel right, but nothing happened (or was going to happen), we were just hanging out as friends, and i wanted to chat, without doing it through a computer screen for once.

i feel like i've just made a good friendship incredibly awkward, i don't think i can ever speak to her again, and if we do, it won't be the same as before. i feel like the biggest fucking dickhead in the world right now.

860,"today i went into des moines with some friends for lunch.  the wait was almost 2 hours, so we went to a clothing store to burn some time.  i wanted to buy a t-shirt there, and went to the dressing room to see how it fit.  the dressing rooms were closed off by shower curtains rather than doors. 

 as i reached behind me to close the curtain, i felt a popping sensation in my left shoulder, followed by immediate pain.  turns out, i had a [subluxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subluxation) in my shoulder joint.

this had happened to me a total of 3 times before, over the course of approximately the last 3 years.  usually, it pops back in by itself within 20 minutes or so, so i thought i could just wait it out.  it wasn't popping in, though, and the friends i was with suggested going to a doctor/hospital.

luckily there was one within five minutes from where we were.  we got there, i got wheeled into the er, and my ""appointment"" began.  ***just*** as the doctor was coming in to put my shoulder back into place, i was taking my shirt off so he could work better.  while i was doing this, sure enough, the shoulder went back in and there was immediate pain relief. 

they shot me in the ass with some anti-inflammatory / pain medicine, prescribed me some vicodin, and sent me on my way.","i reached behind me to close a shower curtain, had a shoulder subluxation, and was taken to the er to get it fixed.  also a nurse there shot me in the ass."

rewind one month ago to late february. i'm with my friend who i'll refer to as phil. phil and i are pretty close friends, been smoking buddies for a while now; i've gotten to know his family and his girlfriends family really well due to mutual friends, similar interests, that sorta stuff. anyway, we're going to do one of our traditional nights of smoking and playing video games at my house. i had just picked him up around 11:30pm on a wednesday night and we were half way back to my house, smoking a bowl that i had packed earlier. i see police lights go off. fuck. we have my grinder and a handful of paraphernalia on top of 2 1/2 grams of bud i had. the cop, who's tense and pissed as fuck, said he pulled me over because i wasn't smart and didn't turn on my hazards to try and indicate i was going to find a safer place to pull off' instead i drove past an intersection first with cruiser on me before pulling off on a side street. that was my first and only real mistake throughout the entire encounter. the reason why he had pulled me over initially was because i had an out license tag light. the cop approached car all apprehensive due to my shakiness from knowing i was fucked and my not pulling over soon enough. i explained to him what we were doing and offered him everything illegal i had in my car and informed him of the 2 knives i keep in my car as well, noting their locations so they wouldn't be alarmed or caught off guard. a second cop ends up showing up and giving him back up, he's more of the stereotypical ""good cop"" to the first tight asses' ""bad cop."" he helps calm us down and helps explain that we're just dumb kids (we're both 20) and that as long as we aren't doing worse drugs like meth, blow, crack, pcp, etc., that we should just keep our petty drug use to our houses, not our cars. after a relatively brief stop of an hour and a half, the cops let my friend phil and i off. both of us have court appearances and i got a $120 ticket, but other than that we have no other repercussions that will or could jeopardize our schooling or potential professional careers. we're still waiting for the court appearances, but neither of our families will need to see or know about this; the cops assured us both that neither of us would have to worry about misdemeanors or anything as long as we accepted our consequences in front of a city judge (he charged me with a city ordinance violation) and our testimony matches the police report. 


**so today was just a dumb fucking deja vu kind of day:**

it's absolutely stupid how certain coincidences like this can happen. it's 2am now on and i'm with my friend, patrick, and his friends. after a long night of smoking pot and hookah, patrick's friend, jake, needs a ride home. i didn't bring my wallet with me today for odd forsaken reason prior to going to patrick's house; i have a copy of my license and registration in my glove box, so i don't worry about being pulled over without my license. anyway, patrick offers to drive, so i ride shotgun and jake rides kurt cobain. after all the smoking we did, you'd think we'd be chimney-ed out or something, right? nope. we had a bowl with us in the car, but you see this wasn't our problem; no, quite the contrary. it's my friend patrick's little coke habit that was the primary concern of tonight's adventure. just by coincidence, we're smoking a bowl on a road not terribly far away from where i was pulled over in the past with phil. what i wasn't told prior to patrick driving us, was that he had been doing lines throughout the night whenever he'd go to the bathroom. he told me that after we were driving away from tonight. so we're mid hit when we see a cop pull out behind us, doesn't have his lights on, but slowly proceeds to turn his headlights and flashers on. why does patrick get pulled over, you ask? his tag light is out. **just my luck** we're all dank smelling and got pulled over out of coincidence. just because i'm lucky, it turns out the same exact cops that pulled me over before, captain hardass and his friend lieutenant bro. patrick, being a little strung out, gives them attitude and acts up like a fucking retard when the cops come over and lies about the bowl we had and whatever else he had in his car (regardless of whether he knew it was there or not). after a lengthy argument with the officer due to patrick's big mouth, all of us are detained and the cops claimed patrick was going to be definitely arrested for having drugs on him, dui, etc. jake, unbeknownst to patrick and myself, has coke on him and doesn't say anything until after we had pulled away; he also had a roach in his lap/pocket too (he got busted for this though). due to patrick's behavior, he was singled out by the cops and they knew he was high on coke and trees. after a long search of his car, lots of sprinkles of coke were found in his car by the search. after some time of being detained and them asking questions, the cops ask me if i have my wallet/identification and i tell them both no. they haven't recognized me yet at this point though and are mainly focused on jake and patrick. jake was honest and the cops took a liking to him (or so we thought). i gave the cops a coherent, yet smart ass response back when they asked if i was sober initially, so lieutenant bro was venomous at the beginning of our encounter. they finally recognize me, and ask me why i didn't have my license and if i was fine enough to drive since i didn't have anything on me. i naturally say i'm fine enough to drive (the adrenaline had snapped me into sobriety) and they believe me. i don't have my license and they pulled me over before, but since i was honest before, they let me slide entirely this time and told me i was to drive off in my friends car to drop off jake. after all of patrick's fuss, he only received a ticket and the equivalent to what i received for my previous run in with those 2 cops, but with the bonus of a more hefty fine. jake received a ticket for the roach, and i got off without anything at all. i'm unbelievably blessed and lucky for what happened. 

 

edit: grammar","because i was truthful and upfront with cops the first time they pulled me over for an out tag light and smoking/having weed, they trusted me to drive off sans drivers license the second time they pulled me over in a friend's car for his own out tag light while we were smoking."
862,"like i said this was years ago but i was just talking about this story last night and i thought i'd share it here.

i was 14 and was hanging out with a friend walking around the woods behind our neighborhood.  we came across a 2x4 and were trying to figure out what stupid thing we could do with it.  we came across this 4x4 raised sewer drain and decided that we could catapult stuff off it using the sweet board we found.  it started off innocent enough with rocks and we were getting some really good distance with it when i spotted a toad.  i tell him to put it on and i'm going to send that baby packing.  i jump on the board and send that sucker flying through the air.  my friend laughing about how far it went says he wants to launch one too, because he knows he cant shoot it farther then i did.  and this is when karma decides to play it's little game.

we find another frog and place it on the board.  my friend is standing on the drain with his back turned to me waiting for me to tell him to go.  well as you all know frogs jump and after i placed him on the board he hops off.  i tell my friend to ""hold on"" and bend down to pick him up to put it back on.  well in his desire to do it he here's me say hold and assumes i'm saying go and jumps as high as he can landing on the board.  the 2x4 comes flying up and crashes into my skull.  it hit between my eye and my temple.  one inch lower and it would have hit me in my right eye and one inch higher and i would have probably been killed.  i immediately throw both hands up to my head cupping around my eye.  i pull both hands down to see if i'm bleeding a little only to see a pool of blood in my hands.  i rip my my white shirt off and get my mom to take me to the hospital, which is where i learned about how lucky the placement of the injury was.  by the time we got there my white shirt had been completely stained red.  10 stitches later and i realized that catapulting frogs is not the best idea.",friend and i thought it would be fun to catapult frogs and got smashed in the face with a 2x4 in between my eye and temple.  had to get 10 stitches and i don't launch frogs in to space anymore.
863,"so, here i am, on my way to catch the train home from my university campus. i live on campus but i work on sundays in my home town. i spend fifteen minutes getting ready to leave and decide that, since i have a little time, i should go to starbucks and grab a coffee. upon entering i see the extremely attractive counter worker (let's just call him matt) making coffees. in my jittery excited state i walk up to the counter and order my cup of coffee and a slice of pumpkin bread from   the employee taking orders. the employee taking the orders tells matt to get my pumpkin bread, to which he replies ""no"". i giggle as he gets the bread. he looks up and says ""oh, but if it's for jazziedax, of course."" with his super gorgeous smile. now normally i wouldn't be fazed by this type of over enthusiastic counter service, but i haven't seen this guy since last semester and didn't give the employee taking orders my name. not to mention that last semester he commented on ""how on earth i could be single"" and such multiple times. so obviously, giggly me gets all flustered and flirts back with him, trying to keep cool under the gaze of his adorable hipster glasses. 

i see my drink finished and i giggle and smile saying ""well, i'll see you around, maybe we could get coffee some time"" to which he replies ""definitely"" with a hair flip. i melt, in my silly 20 year old way and fumble my head phones into position, knocking my bow out of my hair. i stumble to pick it up and head out the door. half way to the train station i realize i should probably print some papers before my train. i reach into my pocket to grab my keys to my dorm room and realize they're not there. so, i turn around and trudge back to the coffee shop and try my best to ask if i left my keys on the counter in the most adorable way possible. matt just stares at me with a blank face and says ""yeah, well umm, you didn't leave them here..."" i turn red faced, bow still askew, looking like a flustered idiot and mumble something along the lines of ""oh i must have left them in the car"" (i don't have a car on campus) and walk out the door. 

now, pissed off that i dropped my keys somewhere i trudge back to my dorm and call my room mate to ask her to let me into the building so i can wait for the next train. upon telling her the whole story she informs me that matt is not only gay.... but has a long term boyfriend.","flirted with a guy, forgot my keys, missed my train, had to go back to find out that i must have dropped them and that he's gay. never going to starbucks again."
864,"this actually happened last friday but i had no internet access. 

first of all, i'm not american, and my first language is not english.

i was in a bachelor party with a big group of friends (18 of us) in a cruise ship. a long time ago, the groom went scuba diving and got sunburnt like a racoon, so we nicknamed him like that, the racoon (in english). as with many nicknames, the racoon evolved to be just ""coon"".

so there we were, 18 of us in a cruise ship with 50% of black people, all wearing tshirts with the word coon in capital letters all across the chest. we are all white. i noticed first, when i was drunk as hell and left the ship's night club and got approached by two enormous black dudes who asked me ""what's with the t-shirt?"". i proceeded to explain about the racoon. they believed, we all laughed and proceeded to be topless for the rest of the night.",i was wearing a t-shirt with the word coon on it
865,"so on halloween we had a fake graveyard with funny names/sayings on them like anna rexic and etc. it took a little while to set up but it came out pretty nice. the day after halloween i decided to leave them in my lawn, as i didn't feel like putting them away and it looked nice and i figured why bother. this continued for the past couple of days as i was extraordinarily lazy. fast forward to today.

my neighbor across the street was a nice older man. he was around 80 years old and had lived in that house for as long as i could remember. he would yell at us for playing street hockey, but only because he was always taking care of his bed-ridden wife of around 50 years, and she was sensitive to sounds. we always respected him and did whatever he needed us to do. he still gave out candy on halloween, but you could tell he wasn't looking very good as of late.

 if you hadn't figured out already, i have to talk about my neighbor in the past tense, as he died early this morning. it was pretty sad. he fell down and died, pretty gruesomely. he broke his neck and his arm he used to brace his fall ended up being ripped to shreds, as his skin was so weak from his age. a very scarring event.

as i was leaving the house this morning, i felt a pretty strong wind, so i decided to go back inside to get a windbreaker. when i went back outside i began walking to my car, but  i noticed something on my old neighbor's front lawn. curious, i wondered over. the closer i got to the object the more my heart started to race. i pick it up and i could not believe what i saw. it was one of my tombstones that got blown over to his house by the wind. not just any tombstone however. the tombstone that ended up on his lawn was that of humpty dumpty, with the phrase ""i was pushed!"" i was horrified. i quickly picked up the tombstone and brought it back to my house. now i believe the reason he left his house was to pick the decoration up off of his lawn, which lead to him falling. the irony, the horror. today i fucked up.","didn't put halloween decorations away, neighbor falls and dies, ironic tombstone already there."
866,"**background**: my mother in law is crazy. she has no regard for anyone else. she is completely selfish and is an alcoholic. i know this, so i do everything i can to not provoke her. everything that happens to her, she complains about to everyone she knows and she lies about everything. unfortunately, my husband and i live with her while we get back on our feet.

i bring lunch to work with me because while at work i am not allowed to leave the property. most nights i remember to make a lunch, but sometimes i forget or run out of time. so i have a big box of hot pockets that i keep in the freezer for a last minute grab while i'm out the door. i don't eat them during the day and my husband won't eat them.

**the story**: last week i house sat for the neighbors. when i came home i find that the box of hot pockets isn't in the freezer anymore and there is a single hot pocket sitting in there. when i left there was at least half a box. at this point i'm frustrated, but happy that i caught it before it was too late. i had time to go to the store to get a new box. i wanted to tell my mother in law (let's call her alice) that i don't want her eating the hot pockets without asking first, or at the very least replacing them. most of all though, i want to know that she's eating them so that way i know when to get more for work. so i had to find the least threatening way to convey this to her without her freaking out.

so, the next time i saw her in passing (we have opposite work/sleep schedules) i asked in the most polite way i could, ""oh alice, i was curious if you've eaten any of the hot pockets?"" her response started out proud but then ended in a question, ""yeah, i had two, or three?"" she stood there for a second and then asked ""why?""

at this point i knew that i had already messed up but it's already happened so i have to finish this. so i just got really quiet and acted a little bummed and said, ""well, i just take those to work.""

at this point she gets very defensive and snaps at me saying that she'll go to the store and replace them. i start apologising and thanking her for making the trip. she then leaves and goes to the store while i go into my room and text my husband that i fucked up. she comes back, slams the door and starts stomping through the house yelling at me. ""there cak3isyummy, i paid you back your hot pockets and then one! now maybe you can pick up your garbage off my floor!""

i stay in my room and just try to not cry. i know that a storm is coming and i just hope that it will blow over soon. i go to my husband's work for dinner and tell him the story of what happened. i then go to work for the night. well he gets home and within an hour of being there, she calls him out to yell at him about me.

she tells him how great she is (she lets us live here, she lets us pay rent next month because we can't afford it this month, she barley charges us for bills etc.) and then goes into how ungrateful and disrespectful i am, that i ""chewed"" her out and how she's ""this close to-"" (she cuts herself off there and he figures she was going to end that sentence with kicking us [or me] out). she then goes into how it's only a couple of dollars and that i shouldn't get so upset about it. he tells her not to worry because we will move out this month (he started looking for places right before she called him out) and she gets offended and says that we don't have to move and blah blah, you know the courtesy argument you're supposed to make in that scenario. anyways now we are looking to move out, and we can't really afford it right now. so now we're going to spend our time at my mom's house and his cousin's house, just so we can get away from her. i haven't seen her since they had that conversation, and i'm going to do everything i can to not see her again or as little as possible. this whole situation is so stressful and i don't even know where to go from here.

 

edit: if you want to know another story of her being crazy i posted about some [petty revenge] (http://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1pkxr8/now_you_have_to_restart_the_dryer/) i got on her.",don't ask your alcoholic mother in law if she ate your hot pockets.
867,"my boyfriend and i moved to our very own first lat together, we were thrilled.
unfortunately the sofa-bed turned out to be a single, as there were some religious holidays it took us five days to get in touch with the landlords who announced that we couldn't swap it as it had been used, but they could probably arrange us a double bed instead.

now, the flat is tiny, a double bed would pretty much fill up the entire room, so we declined and said we'd get our own sofa if they could rid us of this one when we needed it to go.

we decided to get a futon online, argos was offering a nice discount and a garanteed delivery time of two working days. the website refused to accept my bank details, afer several tries, we decided to just walk into their store next door, knowing we'd lose our internet rebate, but hoping we'd still get a fast delivery: no go, we lost both, they offered a delivery two and a hal weeks later.
not thrilled, but it was necessary so we took it.

a week later, i appear to have completely forgotten the dates, and lost the receipt for the couch, so i arrange for the soa-bed to be taken out, as we're getting the futon tomorrow, right?  right?

no, we don't, the receipt decided to come back after the soa-bed was taken away: delivery on the 20th of june.
i have essentially forced us from a slightly uncomfortable bed onto the cold hard floor, because no matter how many blankets i have, the floor is super hard.",i got our current bed picked up a week before the delivery of the new one. my back will ache and the lesson shall be remembered.**
868,"this actually happened a few years back in a college biology class but ever since i was a bit younger ive had a talent for being able to rapidly drink liquids.  one of my friends knowing this about me decides to challenge me one day in class. i agree knowing i can drink this 20 oz of water in roughly 3 seconds. what i didn't know until about 45 min later is that the water i did indeed drink in around 3 seconds had half a bottle of eye drops in it.

869,"background:  i work in the it department of a moderatley large company whose business depends on a particular website being up.

so i am not a server admin.  i am a helpdesk jockey.  but for some reason the server admin guy thought i was ready to take charge of the production deployment (after making me a screencap video of him doing the process, and about 20 minutes of explanation), mostly so he can be on vacation without being hassled. 

this process should have taken about an hour or so, but after 2 hours, and no results, i needed help.  it was about 11 pm, and i thought i was done.  i finished up my work, updated the necessary documents, and sent the 'go ahead' email.  i got a response saying the site is down. i confirm.  i check what i did. i check the directories in all the production environments.  i can't figure it out. by 1:45 am, i doze off, spooning my computer.  i get a call at 5:30 from the cio, freaking out about the website.  oh my god.  i finally get rescued by another it guru at work.  but now i have to wait and see what trouble i'm in.","i messed up the website at work, and now i may or may not get in serious trouble."

871,"i'm taking a culinary class in school, because i absolutely suck at cooking. so we learned a lot of basics, stuff we already know, blah blah blah... and we made apple scones awhile back, and all was good. then, the teacher assigned us to make our own version of the scones, with our own added twist. 

we've all had those maple-bacon donuts, right? maple frosting with bacon bits on top. delicious! so we try to make a copy of that in scone form.

so i did it and it was amazing.  by far the sweetest, best smelling pair i have ever had the pleasure of sampling.  the euphoria swept over me and the urge for more increased.  only one other pair was in plain sight, so i decided to see if the first pair was a fluke.  nope, these were just as sweet, and triggered some really strong sexual urges.  i got control of myself, but everything back the way i found it, and went back downstairs.

the next day, i was still panty crazed, but i decided to go to the next best thing, my wife's.  every other time i had smelled them, they got my motor running in a big way.  not this time.  i felt disgust when i smelled my wife's.  fast forward to today and my wife's panties still smell gross to me and i can't stop thinking about ""jan"".  it is fucking ridiculous, just two whiffs of her has destroyed one of my favorite past times.  no more quick sniffs for me (unless ""jan"" comes to visit again).","wife's panties were the bomb.  then i sniffed my wife's friend's panties, and now my wife's panties make me want to hurl."

   this phone sat in a little office organizer and just stayed plugged in, always watching. earlier this year i had to move the servers to a different building so that my sister can stay here when she got back from college. i bet you see whats gonna happen. the servers got moved out but i forgot about the camera and stopped logging in to check it because i really didn't need to now that the servers were in my room.


   my sister came home for the holidays and the office became her room. no big deal. today i was sitting in my room and guess what! my mom started yelling at me from down stairs. oh shit..... i go down and there they are at the kitchen table. they just lost it. my mom is pretty god damn religious and so is my sister. apparently when my sister got home she saw the phone, on a camera app, and absolutely flipped her shit. i think my mom disowned me during the yell fest. i tried to explain that it was for servers but because the room got rearranged, it was pointed right to the center of the room and apparently she has changed in there many times. they automatically assumed i was spying on her because i'm a horny teenager.


   so now i'm in my room, my dads on the way from work and i have to figure out a way to explain that i'm not a peeper. my mom is downstairs crying to my relatives for some reason and my sister is probably telling all her friends about what a little perv i am. not looking forward to the next few hours.",i had a phone as an ip camera in my office. sister stayed in office. now i'm a disowned peter piper peeper.
879,"actually, several months ago i fucked up. this is how it all went down.

over the summer, i was suffering from a pretty bad bout of constipation. having tried everything else, i put on my shorts, tank top and sneakers and decided i'd go for a nice long run to dislodge the blockage. reddit's many stories of people shitting during exercise were encouraging. however, since it had been such a long time since i'd last shit, i figured i could make it home.

the road loops around my house in a four-mile circle and i've run it many times before without incident. it also passes by the house of a boy i was friends with as a young kid, but since had a few fights with and generally stopped talking to. 

i made it through the first mile and a half or two miles without any incident, but then i realized that my master plan was working all too well. exactly halfway from home, there was no way on earth i was going to be able to make it. after breaking a sweat that had nothing to do with the heat, i tried walking, but that only made it worse.

finally i decided to suck it up and go to that old friend's house. i was going to ask to use their bathroom. his mother had never stopped liking me and i was certain that if only she answered the door, she'd understand. now in full panic mode, i waddled up the front path and rang the doorbell.

nothing. ah, fuck. well, they did like to sleep in and it was early afternoon, so i rang again. and again. still nothing. at that point i knew there was nothing to do but answer the call of nature in nature itself. i made my way around the back of the house, now thoroughly sweating, and looked for some place to do the deed.

a big stretch of woods was about fifty feet from the back of the house but i knew i would never, ever make it. the yard was fairly wide open, but the neighbors' cars were gone so i figured no one was home there either. i was still afraid of doing it right in the middle of the yard but felt i had no choice. i was just getting a grip on the waistband of my shorts when i saw the huge hedge/bush by the side of the house.

my friend's grandfather had hollowed out the inside to make a playhouse for me and his grandson when we were younger, and i knew that they kept up with it because i'd seen him trimming it on previous runs. i dove into the bush, dropped my pants, and did the deed.

it was amazing, aside from having to crouch very low and getting a few twigs stuck in my ponytail. i regret nothing.

i pulled my pants back up, made sure the coast was clear and finished my run. i haven't spoken to him since then, but i always feel a little guilty running by.","shit on a childhood friend's property, regret nothing"
880,"when i wen't over to my friends apartment to do a project, i went over to his kitchen thingy to mooch off some food. i open some cabinets and find some gummies in a bag and start eating them after finishing the large bag of gummies i started to feel like my stomach was about to explode. looking at the bag i realized they were vitamin fiber supplements. i mustve taken a 18 hour shit-time because now i have a giant red ring on my ass..",look before you eat……
881,"well reddit thought you could use a laugh at my stupidity for the last few days, there is a girl i really like and care for we shall call her nikki since she is a redditor also, but i shall take you from the start of my fucks up with nikki, she asked me to describe my perfect girl so i described the complete opposite of her (i did not like her at this point in time), so she holds that one against me for the rest of the time we have known each other. the next fuck up was slight i told her to loose weight because i am an inconsiderate asshole, but she eventually forgave me for this one (i think). so time moves on we become closer, and now i joined the navy, and she is all sorts of pissed off, at the fact of i am leaving her, as she fell for me a little by little; but then i get her flowers on a day she is visiting her boyfriend so once again my hope to make things better ends up in the trash. finally we come to today were we don't talk quiet as much as we used to, and when we do talk, my stupid ass brings of a topic and vents to her about a half naked women roaming my house, needless to say nikki is extremely pissed at me and wants nothing to do with me, i think i completely fucked my chances up, and after i post this if she reads it, that will be a fuck up but hell i've already dug and and laying in my grave so what can i loose right?","throughout the whole time i have been trying to win the heart of a girl i care deeply about, every time i get close i fuck up."
882,"so i work as a level 1 it help desk/computer repairs technician for a small company. my boss is a woman in her early 40's, and she was having router troubles at home. no problem, i can stop over on my way home, fix her router up in 10 minutes and earn some brownie points.

i arrive at the house, ring the doorbell, and wait. keep in mind, this is an expensive house in the rich part of town. these are the sort of people who have more money than i'll ever earn and are extremely proud of it. typical rich bastards, but having them on your side comes in handy more often than not.

20 seconds later an old man answers the door. he looks about 65.

me: ""oh hi, you must be carol's... dad?"" <- mistake #1 what a moron

him: ""husband.""

his face looked like i just ripped a massive fart an inch from his nose. he must have been wondering who the hell i was.

me: ""oh, umm... well. you look a lot older than carol."" <- can i get any dumber?

him: ""can i help you boy?""

i then explain to him why i'm there, and he lets me in. i get to work on the router, when my friend calls my cell and wants to talk. i start chatting away, assuming the husband is still in the kitchen, when i say: ""yeah i'm just at my boss's house fixing the internet for her pedophile husband.""

pedophile husband walks in.

him: ""excuse me?""

i immediately go bright red and hang up on my friend.

883,"so this happened a few hours ago, and after looking back on it realized how dumb this was. so to put a little setting, was on my girlfriend's bed, about to receive head (or whatever else you want to call 3rd base). being the mature shit i am, i saw a sealed bottle of vanilla coca-cola next to her bed, and that my flies were undone. obviously, i *had* to do it.

so when gf comes back in, she looks at me, sighs, laughs, and goes along with it. after a bit of 'penis' touching, she decided to open the cap. this is when we both found out it had been shaken, a lot. within a few seconds, both my girlfriend and i, along with her bed, some of her clothes and a large portion of the floor were covered in vanilla coke. after looking at me for a few seconds, she just started raging on about how long it would take to clean up.",vanilla coke caused premature ejaculation.
884,"my dad grew up as a poor black kid in a shit part of the bronx ny, and self-emancipated himself at a very young age. he had an abusive stepfather and wasn't interested in keeping any family ties. 

several decades later after a tour in vietnam and having a family with 3 (bi-racial, i'm very light skinned) kids he received a surprise visit from his sister (i was about 8 at the time, she bought me a sega genesis - greatest aunt ever). now this sister is the unpredictable one, she loves to fuck with people. my dad owned a small business and she came in, posing as a customer, and was flirting with him, asking all kinds of questions - really playing it up. it was a great surprise for him and they were both extremely happy to reconnect. 

so flash-forward almost 19 years, and i receive a phone call from my aunt - she's in town on business and would love to get together! she's only here for two days, and will be running around town, so our plans are not concrete.. ""i'll see you when i see you...""

alright, so i work in a small boutique branding and web-dev firm. we are strictly by appointment only, and we maybe get a few random walk-ins a year. it's also important to note that i work in a predominantly white area, so maybe 1 in 10 of those walk-ins will be black people. 

today, while waiting to hear back about when we will connect, there's a knock on our office door. my aunt! she looks about her age and height, who else could it possibly be? i open the door: ""long time no see! how are you??"" **huge, loving embrace**. i spark up a typical conversation you might have with someone you haven't seen since your childhood, and she's asking me some odd questions vaguely related to what we do in the office, i give her some pointers and continue on with the conversation. at this point something seems terribly wrong, she's withdrawn and a little freaked out. i realize i may have made a terrible mistake, but wait - this is the aunt that loves to mess with us, this must all be an elaborate ruse.. 

me: ""can i ask you an odd question?""

her: ""uh, sure."" 

me: ""i always have the hardest time pronouncing your name, how do you say it properly""

her: ""vanessa"" (not my aunts name)""

me: ""okay okay, are you my aunt [aunt's name]?""

her: ""what? no, i am not your aunt.. what kind of question is that?""

me: ""[aunt's name], are you fucking with me right now?""

her: *laughs* ""oh no, i'm not fucking with you.""

me: *awkwardly opens the door and looks outside to see if my aunt is hiding out there*

yeah, definitely not her. she laughed it off, and thanked me for the hug.. better than it could have been but god damn i'm so embarrassed i could die. i think she went along with it because she was afraid she knew me but forgot who i was.",accosted some random midle-aged black woman looking to hire my firm and accused her of being my aunt**
885,"i'm still a bit off, but i was traumatized by the visual of what happened for most of the day.

i work with my brother in a small commercial warehouse off of a relatively busy street (commercial area, lots of trucks, pickups, cars).  our warehouse is one of about 10-- two parallel buildings of ~5 with a parking lot in between, a fence at the far end, and direct access to the street. the neighbor at the far end of the lot, david, has an automotive repair business which has a lot attached.  small lot, fits about 4 or 5 cars.  david also has an awesome white bull terrier he keeps at the shop named mohawk.  mohawk is always pretty dirty, but still super friendly.  as most pent up dogs would, he loves to chase a tennis ball.  

i threw the ball around a bit, towards the entrance of the parking lot.  david, my brother, and i were chatting, so i was only half paying attention to throwing the grungy, busted-up tennis ball.  as we all start to go back in to get back to work, i stupidly decide it would be fun to throw the ball as hard as i could.  i just did not think it through.  

half a second after i'd thrown the ball i started to connect the dots.  i chased and yelled at mohawk, but he was in a dead sprint.  as soon as he hit the road, i saw a large white box truck speed in from the left.  the driver slammed on his brakes immediately, and i must admit he was really on point, but there simply was no way.  there was the shortest of yelp, almost drowned out by the truck's screeching tires.  it was only a split second, but i watched as mohawk tumbled underneath the truck.  he did multiple barrel rolls before he was dragged out of view to the right, where the truck shuddered to a stop.

the entire event seemed unreal, but honestly it was exactly what i imagined would happen a moment before it actually did.  picture the scene from bride of chucky where the character backs into traffic and is creamed by the semi truck.  my heart sank, and i realized i had made one of those massively big mistakes that you can't fix, is completely terrible, and will lead to some serious problems.  i'm not sure how we would have coexisted as neighbors after that.  and i love dogs!  i play with mohawk every day, and he's really opened up since the t-shirt business brought their big black lab, negra, to play and flirt with him (mohawk still has his pelotas).  he's always cooped up, so he's super pumped to run or chase anything at all.  mohawk runs balls out each and every time- til the pads on his feet bleed, according to david.  but now all i could think about was a big smear of blood under the truck.

no more than a second had passed after the truck stopped when, like a bolt of lightning, the grey beast comes sprinting back.  as i watched with wide-eyed amazement, mohawk streaks past and into the lot at the end.  at this point i was a bit stunned by my emotional roller coaster ride.  i ran out to the street to check on the truck and driver, who was fine and didn't even give me any grief.  i then jogged back to david's shop to see if mohawk actually was alright.  i've been on a house marathon, so my imagination ran wild with how mohawk might end up dying from this trauma.  kidneys always seem to be the first to go.

i tentatively went back to check on mohawk.  everyone else was already back there - about five people in total.  he seemed to be alright, but he was cowering and cut up.  his hind leg trembled, and it seemed to hurt when prodded.  other than that he was fine.  i apologized a million times to david, though i also knew that i was extremely lucky.  i couldn't think of any other way it could have turned out better.  david was upset, and i knew well enough to leave him alone for a while.

i decided to head off and get something nice for mohawk as well as david.  i'd read here on reddit just the other day about being able to buy side orders of meat at chipotle for cheap.  i gunned it over to chipotle and ordered some steak.  i live in a college town so i figured it was likely someone else had already tested out the side-order trick.  $2.35, not too shabby.  afterwards i swung by the liquor store and picked up a twelve pack of tecate's, as they seem to be david's favorite.

tomorrow will tell how mohawk truly fared.  apparently this is not mohawk's first encounter with a vehicle.  he was run over by a volvo a couple years back, breaking three ribs and a leg.  he still has an indentation from the tire.  he is one hell of a pooch, and i'm glad he's alive.

886,"my cat dusty, is a indoor outdoor cat. for whatever reason, when you try to pet him while hes relaxing outside he'll run way from you into bushes or something. i tried to pet him and he ran into a little strip of trees that separate the (busy) road from our house. i thought little of it because i assumed he had enough sense to stay away from the cars.

i went away to the skate park for some fun. when i got home some guy came over to cut up a giant tree that had fallen on our lawn. he went to the tree and came back a few minutes later and asked us if we *had* a cat. fuck. dusty's leg was ripped off and he bled out behind the tree a few feet from our front door. i guess he got hit by a car. i wish i hadn't tried to pet him, and i don't think i'll tell my family i tried to. he had 4 leisurely years on this earth.","inadvertently chased cat into road where he lost a limb, made some poor guy tell my family that my cat was dead, and everyone in the house helped dig the grave."
887,"i guess by the title of this post, most people would just use their common sense and realize it was a mistake.. not me, i was in a poop covered rage and couldn't think clearly.

let me tell you how it all went down.

my dog tends to chew things. usually things that i love, shoes, movies, exercise equipment. so to combat this i put him in a kennel while i am at work. it's not cruel, it's a very large kennel and he has tons of room, he can walk around stretch out ect. 

i came home from work, literally an hour and a half ago and unlocked the door to be hit right in the face with the sickest fucking smell i've ever smelt. it was super hot out today as well, at least 28 celcius and it made it so much worse. like walking into a wall of pure, hot shit. and not just regular shit here, liquid, frothy shit. the entire bottom of his kennel is shit. and he's just standing there, covered in his own poop and wagging his tail. after spending a full on minute cursing i work up the nerve to move the cage, i figure if i can open up the sliding doors onto my deck and shove the kennel across the kitchen i can set the dog out straight into the yard. so i get a move on and this is when it's starting to get bad, the poop is splooshing out over the sides of the cage and leaving a long, yellow trail all the way to the door. other than that i manage to get him out without too much trouble. now it's the kennels turn and it just barely fits through the door, so here i am awkwardly shoving this nightmare through my sliding door and onto my deck. 

this is where it gets interesting. the sun is beating down on me as i try to reach my garden hose over to the kennel. it will not reach, i have to get the kennel down the steps and onto the lawn to hose it off.

i begin sliding the kennel across the deck and it starts catching on the wooden boards, everytime it catches it splashes a little poop wave up and onto my shoes. by this point i don't even care, i'm just shoving it along as hard as i can and by the time i reach the stairs i am in pure rage mode. so i shove it, hard. the bottom of the kennel slides out and rockets dog shit down the stairs, all over the stairs and all over the cement and grass below. and the hose, does. not. reach.

the worst part of the whole thing is that once i finally get the cage picked up and over to the hose i look up and my neighbor ( who totally fucking hates me) is standing there smiling, implying she just watched the whole thing.",my bitch of a neighbor watched me body slam a kennel full of shit down my deck stairs.
888,"so today in class we are watching some video about a viola player, when a nervous looking girl comes in. our school is doing a fundraiser for starving children. so she starts her presentation with a badly made video and everything is going fine. 

so then pictures of starving children start being shown. everyone is soaked in and focused on this video. no one is talking. i turn and see everyones eyes glued on the horrific images. then, a picture of an african baby being held up by hands comes up. you cant see who is holding it, just the hands.

889,"so i have a really hot massage therapist. don't get me wrong, i wouldn't keep going to her if she weren't really good and skilled at what she does, but i also happen to think that she's really freaking gorgeous.

as a *result* of her being hot and my getting massages from her, i always got a healthy chub every time i went. i figured since the rest of my body was getting a stretch, rubdown, etc, it wouldn't kill me to flex my dick muscle a little, just to make sure that it felt all stretched out and all during my massage. you know, because **i'm a fucking idiot.**

this week, i decided to see how visible my chub was when i flexed my dick muscle from underneath the blanket(i don't know what the fuck it's called and i know that one of you knows out there on reddit so feel perfectly free to correct my stupid ass). i looked at my dick while it was covered by the massage blanket and started flexing that good ol' muscle again. **holy fuck my massive erection was visible as fuck.** it looked like a costco hot dog flailing around, wondering when *it* was gonna get rubbed down.

now, i've been seeing this girl every other week for 4-5 months. she gives an hour for 30 dollars and i tip her 20 every time. i've never said anything sexually suggestive and have *never* dreamed of trying anything physical with her in the middle of a session. it probably doesn't hurt that i'm not terribly painful to look at and that i follow all her advice on how to stretch properly and all. but those extra tips feel much more deserved knowing that she's had to deal with my bullshit boners all these months.

i *want* to say that it was a positive thing because she calls me to ask if i need a massage and all, or just from the way she looks at me, but i'm sure it's just me trying to fool myself into not feeling as awkward about it.",i happily flexed a big boner for my hot masseuse. she was exceptionally cool about it.**

so a couple of minutes after i get the invite and i accept. so far everything is fine, when suddenly one of the guys from upper management (not the one who invited to the call), says ""who the fuck is titler?"". that's when it hit me, i really fucked up. i forgot that i have that silly displayname and a pretty fucked up [picture](http://imgur.com/4ij4knk) to accompany it (nsfw).

yesterday was my first night at the university after a two-month vacation that felt like a fucking eternity. what else was there for a college guy to do? bring on the booze! beer, whiskey, some sort of cheap mojito mix, anything goes!

as i started to get fucking drunk as shit, i began to lose my sense of everything. i remember getting home to our boarding house. i remember not being able to walk straight. i remember going to bed, trying to get some sleep. i remember pulling myself out of bed because i needed to puke. i remember puking on our sink. i remember deciding that i need to take a piss. i remember going to our (common) bathroom (third world. that's just how it is.). that's all the i remembers that i can muster.

now for the fuck up part.

i woke up 8 in the morning today, with the worst hangovers of my current existence (and yes, my hangover lasted for almost 13 hours, maybe even more). except i wasn't on my bed. *i was on the bathroom floor, only my shirt on, shit on the toilet, shit on the floor.*

i felt that i should be bewildered, but my splitting headache just couldn't let me gather up enough what-the-fuck-why-am-i-half-naked-surrounded-by-my-own-shit feelings, so i did what i had to do. i put on my pants (which was in the bathroom), flushed the toilet, and cleaned up the rest that was on the floor. getting rid of the evidence. i went out of the bathroom, glad that no one saw me, and to our empty room to get some more sleep.

such was not exactly the case.

as i was about to get back to bed, i saw something out of the ordinary. *why the hell are there spots of puke on my bed?* great. icing on the shit cake. fml.

all was well and good... then it hit me, the two large cups of bojangles sweet tea that is. and of course, being the classiest of ladies, i got up to take a massive shit. went and found the bathroom and got down to business. turns out, it was more massive than i thought. my thoughts? ""shit, that's a lot of shit"". disregarding the copious amount of fecal matter, i flushed anyway. worst decision i have made in my life. and unsurprisingly, i clogged that bitch. frantically searching for a plunger and to no avail did i find one. not wanting to tell my friends what i had done and having them ridicule me, i improvised. the next best thing i could find was an empty toilet paper roll. next thing i new was that i was wrist deep in my own waste, hurriedly digging with my new found tool.

897,"ok so a little background first: 

i am the head of set construction/ running crew for my school's technical theater club. right now we are building the set for chicago:the musical. we have these things called ""flys"", which are weighted ropes that control bars running across the ceiling of the stage which we use to hang things from. 

back to the fuck up:

 there is a huge screen that the school usually uses for various assemblies as a projection screen for power points, presentations, etc.. we had to take the screen off to use the bar for our proscenium, or border surrounding the stage. anyways, we get to the rope and it is incredibly weighted, making it difficult to lower and nearly impossible to raise. it took 2 grown men plus 4 high school students just to get it all the way to the ground. once we get the screen off, everyone else begins to attach the border to the bar. my genius self thinks ""oh, let me raise the bar to get it out of their way."" so i walk over to the lock which is holding the bar in place, unlock it, grab hold of the rope, and immediately shoot 20 feet into the air. i am literally dangling 2 stories up on nothing but a rope. my friends rush over to help lower the rope i was hanging on and get me down safely, but my hand got wicked ropeburn from me gripping the rope so tightly:

900,"here's some backstory for you all. my current girlfriend and i are in secret from our school, other than for a few people. she's an actress, and i sing. we both are participating in our school's annual talent show.


so a few days ago, we were at rehearsal. we're all sitting through the bad acts, waiting for our own performances, when my mother calls. she asks me to walk down to the other building to grab a book my little brother left in his locker.


so, eager to spend a few minutes alone with my girlfriend (no, not like *that*, it's just that hiding a relationship is hard), i asked her if she'd walk down with me. it would only take 5 minutes to walk down and back up, i said.


so, my school has a uniform, and for rehearsal, i had packed clothes into which i could change. of course, i forgot shoes. unwilling to wear my school (uncomfortable) shoes, and very willing to seize the opportunity to be barefoot, i went shoe-less that evening. but back to the story.


i'm in a very good mood, maybe because i'm with this girl, so i'm skipping down the sidewalk and down the stairs to our building. i vaguely remember stubbing my toe and thinking nothing of it.


we reach the building, and try the side door: locked. front door: locked. other side door: unlocked. so we walk in, parade down the first hallway, cross into another, and walk halfway down the third when i looked down and saw the blood. i was practically standing in a pool of blood. okay, mild hyperbole, but i was bleeding pretty profusely. and, even worse, i had trailed blood all across the carpet and tile.


i stop my girlfriend, show her the blood, and start hopping to the locker rooms to rinse off my toe and grab some paper towels. remember, the building is totally empty, seeing as it's eight o'clock or so. so i grab wet paper towels and take care of wrapping up my foot properly (and putting on shoes i'd left in the locker room). then, we get to cleaning all the blood spots.


alone, we spend about ten-fifteen minutes cleaning up each individual toe-shaped blood print from the carpet. then, once satisfied with our job (and after grabbing my brother's darned book), we walk outside. i figure this is fate, even though i don't really believe in fate. i rarely get alone time with her, and we'd never kissed. if i didn't seize this opportunity now, i knew i'd regret it. 


so halfway up the few flights of steps outside, i stop and hug her under the pretext of needing to catch my breath, since i was running in joy. after i caught my breath a few moments later, i tilted my head up and whispered,
   ""i'm going to regret so much tonight if i don't do this...,"" and i'm going to kiss her, but her face was so close i just got so scared. keep in mind i'm an awkward fucking penguin and have never kissed anyone. then i bury my face in her chest as she said,
   ""what, not kissing me?"" and i'm just like, ""i'm scared,"" giggling in the night. then i say,
   ""no regrets,"" and i look up, and she's already looking up at me, and then it just happened.


i haven't gotten to the fuck-up part, yet. after the peck, we walked back up to the original building. at this point, our teacher claimed we were ""eaten by wolves"" and our friend was out looking for us. we realized what it looked like. i quickly pulled out my foot and showed anyone who questioned what we were doing outside, in the darkness, for 20 minutes, the bloody toe. but wait. there's more.

the next day, as i'm walking from class to class, i see a fucking *trail of blood* from one building to the other. i see middle school girls pointing and starting in fear. i hear people asking,
   ""whose blood is that!?""


i, in response, poker face. i now have to face the trail of blood every time i walk to a class. the trail of shame. my fucking lord. tifu.","i stubbed my toe in the darkness and bled all over my school, and now i have to pretend it's not my blood every time i walk from class to class."
901,"edit: lending *my* phone. sorry.

i'm in college. yesterday in art class there were some high school girls talking with the professor. they were kind of good looking. so, as the dumb man that i am, i texted a friend telling him about these girls with the meme picture ""dat ass"" attached.

i think you guys know where this is going.

today she had an hour without class and she was going to wait for me so we could go to my place and watch a movie. she asked me for my phone, so that she wouldn't get bored. her phone is a nokia. again, as the dumb man that i am, i gave it to her. we jokingly agreed that she would not look at my messages. at this point i didn't even remember about those messages.

well, she made a drama about it after class. saying that she didn't want to be my girlfriend anymore. i tried to talk her...when suddenly, i don't know why the fuck i did it, but i let out an ""i love you"". we've been together for 3 months. this apparently didn't help. at all. she told me to go fuck myself.

i really care about this girl, after all we've shared together, i can actually say that i love her, and i don't want to lose her over this stupidity of mine.","girlfriend saw messages saying that i was checking some girls' ass, i said i loved her, was told to go fuck myself."
902,"i'm italian, yet the whitest kid in my family. i discovered awhile back that i never sunburn, no matter what. i also don't tan very easily either. i would go with friends to outside festivals or concerts without sunscreen on, and by the end my friends would be all burnt and i'd be completely fine. i did this for about 2 years, that is until i was diagnosed with lupus. luckily it's not the deadly kind, and it's only present on parts of my skin (not systemic). however, i'm basically allergic to the sun. for the past 2 years i've essentially been making my body destroy & repair itself repeatedly. i was dumb...not sure when i'll experience the repercussions for all that but it's probably gonna suck. remember kids, if you have a unique physical trait, it may just be a deadly disease. also wear sunscreen and don't be a ginger or you're gonna burn.","exploited my inability to get sunburns, turned out i was ""allergic"" to the sun and was destroying my body."

905,"and i didn't shit myself, but my stomach felt incredibly bad and i got the hershey® squirts™. i still feel a little on edge,",don't reset the counter.
906,"so over the past few days i have had a building stomach ache which i thought was just gas etc. it was mild discomfort really, nothing to worry about. or so i thought. 

i had a date last night, it went swimmingly, even though my stomach hurt. i had another date scheduled for tonight, and as my stomach hurt more and more i chose to warn her that plans may change. 

i went out to lunch with the girl i had been with last night, indian food, which is pretty ballin, and tasty as shit. things went well, aside from some gurglings in my midsection. 'gas' i thought, nbd. unfortunately after lunch on my way back to work, and thankfully after saying goodbye to my lunchdate, i try to relieve some of the pressure by taking a much needed fart. instead of relief i realized in horror that a solid glop of liquid shit had come out. i immediately half stand up in my truck, as i am wearing my overcoat, i pull it up, sit back down thinking i had saved it, then remembered my truck seats are fabric. in desperation i pull over a gift bag i have in my truck from transporting christmas presents, pull the gift out (it really was nicely wrapped) and shove the bag under my ass praying the cause of the putrid smell in my truck hadnt yet seeped through. 

i immediately begin gunning my truck back to my apartment, about five minutes away from where i work (lucky), swing into the lot, ever feeling the shit keep dripping from my ass, for some reason i couldnt stop the flow, and god my intestines were about to make me scream. as i hurredly park my truck, get out, and remove my overcoat, i can feel gritty feel of the shit particles in my pants chafing, and in horror i look at the bag which had been under me and there is no sign of the liquid. i run upstairs, barge in on my roomate, run into the bathroom, and promptly step in dog piss as he hadnt let his dog out recently. 

i sit down on the toilet, without even closing the door, and begin spraying a disgusting, green stream of shite, groaning and bemoaning my fate. i shrug out of the pants as fast and best i could, and figure out where the liquid had gone. almost the entire back of my pants was tinged brown green.

so, here i am, desperately pissing a stream of shit from my ass, looking at my favorite pair of now ruined jeans, and what used to be my lucky boxers, groaning as my intestines try to tear themselves out of my body, and my boss texts me to ask where the fuck i am and inquire why i am not at work. 'sorry, shoe broke, be back in a jiff' is the only response i could think of. 

 i stand up eventually, nearly puking at the smell, my roommate having booked it when he heard the first splatter, flush the toilet four times, hop in the shower, nearly crying in desperation as i try to rinse myself off from the evil i just experienced. as i wimper and hurriedly find new clothes to rush back to the office, i once again drag my foot through dog piss on the floor. 

i get back to my truck, throw the bag (which smells of the vile, green shit) into a dumpster and make it back to work just in time for my manager to stop at my desk and ask if i had 'fun clowning around during lunch, and please get back to your damn work'.","descended into the depths of hell, resurfaced a shaken man."

909,"about a week ago, i bought several cans of tomatoes. today, i made my first attempt at homemade salsa.  i chopped up three jalapenos and a few hotter peppers and washed my hands.  

then i chopped up the garlic and washed my hands.  

blended everything up and (you guessed it) washed my hands.  

then i washed my hands again.  

and again.

a bit later, i had to go to the bathroom.  my fingers touched my lady parts.  instantly, regret filled my mind.  ""but wait,"" i thought, ""i washed my hands, like, ten times! everything should be fine!"" nope! as soon as i stood up, fiery pain swept through my lady garden. 

i needed help.  i looked at my boyfriend and said, ""i feel like gob"" and told him the whole sordid affair.  he googled and told me that milk would help extinguish the burning, so i grabbed the rest of the half gallon we had in the fridge, ran to the bathroom and poured ice cold milk on my angry vagina.  nothing could have felt worse.  burning quickly turned into icy horror as my vag tried to close up and escape.

910,"i'll start off by giving you a little background.  i am 16, and my little sister is 7.  she was bored and wanted to go hang out at her friend's house down the street.  so i took her there.

when we got there, her friend insisted on showing me his new go kart. so i said sure.  we went to his garage, and he showed me his go kart.  i asked if i can try it out and he said sure. i rode it around for about a minute and then got off.

then my sister asked if she can try it. i was skeptical at first because she's never driven anything like this.  but then i thought, *""it has four wheels. it's not like she's gonna flip it or anything.""*

so i told her she can. i showed her all the controls. how to steer, how to go, and how to brake. then i step away and let her go.

she then proceeded to drive straight into a porsche. her friend's dad's porsche.  everyone freaked out, and ran inside to tell him.  and to make matters worse, they exaggerated a lot and told him the scratch was ***huge*** and she was going ***super fast*** when she crashed into it.

the dad was super nice about it, but i felt guilty as fuck. i said sorry multiple times. and i told my sister to apologize but she never did.

then about 20 minutes later as we were leaving, i told my sister to go say thank you for all the snacks they gave her and for being so cool about everything.  but instead of saying thank you, she started crying because she didn't want to go. the crying then turned into screaming and yelling and calling me names.  i finally had to carry her out of there because she refused to leave.  i kept on apologizing as we were leaving.

i've never felt so fucking stressed out and embarrassed in my entire life.

i was wrong. 
i came home to my 4 year old climbing on the railing of our balcony and the sitter tells me ""i think the dog hurt his leg"".  
i look at the dog and my 5 month old puppy that we have only officially had for 4 damn days (we participate in rescue/foster dogs and only officially adopted him 3 days before) is writhing in pain.  
i ask him what happened, to which his response is, ""i don't know"" and he leaves.  i in turn ask my 4 year old son what happened, and he proceeded to tell me that while he (my 4 year old son) was climbing the railing of the balcony, the dog's foot got caught in the chair... he's four nothing made sense.    
so after spending all night at the after hours vet and receiving an estimate for $5k, i now have a dog with a broken leg that i can't afford to fix. and i need to find a new sitter.

914,"so tonight one of my friends who i'm going to call brett (by request) because i don't know how he'd feel about having this on reddit, asked if i wanted to hang out and get some ice cream. this was the first time we were meeting in person; i had played dota with him, and we had mutual friends, but we had never spent any time in person together. i was kind of excited/ nervous because i'm not very social and i don't make friends easily. 

he comes to my house at around 19:45, and we head off to get ice cream at the dairy queen in my town. it was next to an empty a&p, so i suggested we go to my park so we don't seem completely suspicious sitting in his car, eating ice cream. 

we head off to the park, and when we get there i check for signs saying when its closed because i don't want to get in trouble. i don't see any signs so we pull in and park close to the entrance. we decide to sit in the back because the front of his car really has no room or anything. so were just sitting there, talking, getting to know each other, eating some ice cream, when we see car lights flash by us. i think ""oh, maybe other people had the same idea as us?"". nope. it's the cops.

so brett moves to the front of the car so he doesn't look like a total creeper, and rolls down the window to talk to the officer (female). she asks what we were doing, our names, blah blah blah. however, when she gets to my name, she pauses. my dad has lived in this town his entire life, is very active in the town, even being the president of the town council. woopdefuckingdoo for me.

the officer goes back to her car and tries calling my dad first, but he's asleep, so she tries my mother. but instead of my mother's number, they have my number. so i have an incredibly awkward conversation with the officer, explaining that i'm not in fact my mother, but the person she's had sitting in the parking lot for about 10 minutes. the officer now gets about fifty times more suspicious... great. it also turns out that the park closes at sunset (whoops).

after about 10 more minutes, the sargent shows up and tells us that brett can leave, but i have to go home with the officer. i go to sit in the front seat, but nope! i get the honor of sitting in the back with incredibly hard seats and a cage surrounding me. the officer asks me if i'm hot, and i start thinking does she mean high? drunk? sexy? so i go well... i don't *think* i'm very attractive, but my boyfriend tells me otherwise. i don't think i've ever gotten a stranger look from a person in my entire life. ""what the hell are you talking about? i was asking if you were hot, like if you wanted me to open the window or something!"" yup. i'm a freak. then she asks me what i was doing at the park. ""we got ice cream and decided that an empty parking lot was a suspicious place to hang out, and that the park would be better"". another weird look, but she's smiling. i continue ""yeah, it was the first time we were meeting in person. i guess you could call this our first date."" she goes ""...oh..."" and doesn't say another word the rest of the ride.

so i get home, but i'm not allowed out of the car yet. the sargent followed us home and is now ringing my doorbell to talk to my dad. after about 5 minutes, i'm let out of the car and brought back to my house. my dad doesn't seem upset at all, because i didn't really do anything wrong, thank god. the police leave, and i go back inside to type this up.

so i had a rum and coke in me and decided to have a bath to explore myself and whatnot. so i run the bath and it's hot as hell but whatever, i tough it out and eventually i manage. begin fapping.

i won't go into fapping details because seriously wtf not important but after awhile i started feeling really hot, so i stood up in the tub. i continue happily on my feet for a few seconds and then suddenly dizziness hits me like a truck. fapping stops and i'm like ""oh shit not this"". i've passed out before and i had all the warning signs i was on the road to faintsville. i drop back down into the tub and i'm leaning over the edge. at this point i'm trying to get a hold of myself, when i notice my pulse in my neck. or lack thereof. my heart was beating every 2-3 seconds it felt like. shiiiiiiiiiit.

naturally i start to panic a bit so i climb out of the tub and prepare to take a nap on the nice floor in front of the sink. the ac in the bathroom and tv going outside start to sound rather muffled and i'm just like ""don't pass out don't pass out ooooomg don't pass out"" but luckily i started to get back under control after getting horizontal for a bit. floor is wet as shit now and family apparently heard the commotion, asking if i was ok. ugh.","hot water + boner + standing up is a recipe for heart failure, apparently."

for a time last night, i was a hero. i am only 18 and my friends and i had plans to go to a house party last night however, those plans fell through. all of my friends were prepared to spend a night in bored until i said fuck that and planned a trip into ybor. though, being 18 year old high school kids many of my group were un able to do this on account of parents and curfews. our plans fell flat again until i remembered this crazy neon motorcycle festival going on downtown.

everyone was able to go and we had an awesome time. there were crazy biker people everywhere tents and vendors selling head wraps and neon lights to attach to harleys. there was even a really good ac/dc cover band there. we are all buzzed off of the beer we brought but it didn't last us very long and the vendors selling jäger were pretty expensive so when the band finished up and left i decided to try my luck at the closest bar. it worked. 

the bartender was pretty busy and didn't have the time to check id or anything so she ended up serving us through the night. the waitress however was having none of our shit so we had to sit at the tables outside. no big deal, we were still sort of in a bar and we were getting service so life was good. at this point during the night three more joined our group including tino, my good friend who i will call robert, and the girl he had been having relations with for the past few months, maya. we hang out for a while and have an awesome time and i get significantly drunker than i had intended. somehow when we all get up to leave, i end up going with these three.

i have been drinking at a furious rate and i believe that my body continued to absorb the alcohol as i stumbled to robert's car. my ego is huge at this point. i have saved the night and i deserve to be recognized for my greatness. the girl who i have been texting all night fell asleep or something so i need to find another outlet for my raging greatness. soon i find that maya and i are getting along great. 

we are all laughing and having fun when we get into robert's car. i can't even hear what i am saying and my last clear memory is making out with maya and robert saying ""what the fuck dude"" 

skip to this morning and i am still a little drunk. i text my friend henry to find out what happened last night and i am horrified to see what he has to say. he tells me that i not only made out with maya, i also ended up puking in robert's car. fuck me. henry tells me that i am a butthole when i am drunk, but consoles me by saying ""you can definitely post in tifu now""","got really drunk, made out with my friend's girlfriend and puked in his car."
918,"well, here's the story. i was downloading something, and because the download needed 5+ hours to be completed, i decided that it would be a good idea to get some sleep. i put the laptop near the edge of my bed (yes stupid move, i know) and go to sleep on the other side. 

i am woken up by my grandmother's shouting and i immediately saw that i had kicked my mother's laptop off the edge, screen down. tifu indeed.",: never sleep with your laptop near you. they are of the fucking devil.
919,"this just happened about 40 minutes ago, i was at my friends house even there since about 8pm and we just smoke out, fast forward to about 4am and my friends brother and his boyfriend come home with a bunch of there girl friends. we end up drinking a bit and smoking even more, this is where it starts: at about 5am we all end up getting ready to fall asleep and i'm in the room with all the girls (mind you i'm the only guy in the room now) i'm laying down on the floor trying to fall asleep when my stomach starts to bubble. fuck, why am i getting gas right now!!!! i'm just laying there holding it in when bbbbaaaammmmmmm! i fart like i've never farted before, very strung out loud and smelly one at that. i'm praying to god that the girls in the room were fast asleep…dead wrong -_- one starts giggling then all of them start whispering around ""did you hear that?!?!"" i am in utter shock and just pretend to be asleep until they all quiet down and hopefully fall asleep, 15 minutes later…another earth shattering fart!!! i can't take the embarrassment anymore jump up grab my shit and run faster than i ever have before outta there. i'm waiting for the bus to go home now. reddit i fucked up",i had two earth shattering farts in a room full of girls.
920,"this happened a little while ago actually.

a little backdrop for this story. i'm on the club cross country team at michigan state university. this year, our national meet was at hershey, pa. given the 10 hour drive, we left friday morning and got back on sunday night, with the meet being on saturday morning. this, of course, gave way for partying on saturday night. as a team, we stayed in a hotel not too far away from the course with some other schools that were racing.

also, when i get drunk, i tend to get angry for whatever reason. 

with all that being said, i decided to party and have some fun. as the night progressed on, i of course, preceded to get more and more drunk. finally, at about 1:00 am, the anger starts to kick in. i get so mad that i decide to put on my jacket and some shoes, and go out for a run to simmer down. before anyone could stop me, i took off running straight down the road. 

i should let you know that i was extremely unfamiliar with the area. in fact, i knew none of the roads. the only landmark i knew was that i was staying in a hilton hotel across the street from a wal-mart. 

after a few miles, i sweat out some of the alcohol and started to sober up a bit. i, of course, realized how stupid it was to go running late at night, while drunk, in area i was completely unfamiliar with. so, i had the natural reaction of turning around and going back to the hotel. unfortunately, after a while, i started to realize how nothing looked familiar from before. i decided to keep going forward in the hopes of seeing something that would lead me to the hotel. of course, there was nothing.

having nothing on me except my hotel key card, i had no way to call someone for help or to guide me back to the hotel. panic started to kick in as i realized i was completely lost in the middle of pennsylvania. my first reaction was to see if i could find somebody on the roads that could help me. with it almost being 2:30 now, there were very few cars out and almost no restaurants or businesses open. i wave down a few cars and even stop in a mcdonald's to ask for directions but no one could lead me back to the hotel. 

but, seeing no other hope, i keep trying. a few more cars pass by and eventually a car pulls over. i tell the driver, a middle aged women, my story and she informed me that there was a hilton about 5 miles north of us. she even offered to give me a ride. under any other circumstances, i would have immediately said no thanks but i was now very tired and still a little scared. reluctantly, i hop in this stranger's car and hope for the best. fortunately, she was an extremely kind women and nothing happened. she took me back the hotel and it was the right one.",got pissed off when drunk. went for a run in a place i was very unfamiliar with and had to hitchhike my way back to the hotel.
921,"today i was sitting at home watching archer. i took out my phone to check it, and realized that part of the phone's soft plastic case had torn. so me, always wanting to mcguyver everything, went and got the krazy glue and tried to glue the phone's case together (i took the phone out, so i'm not completely retarded.)

as i'm squeezing the tube, nothing emerges from the nozzle. i wonder if perhaps the glue in the nozzle had dried. then when i lifted the tube, i noticed drops falling from it. the glue had burst out the end of the tube and was now dripping all over!

some had gotten on my finger, didn't get it glued to any other body parts but still was rough on the skin. i went and ran it under some water, which is about all you can do to treat that. then i walked back to where the phone case was to check if my glue job held (i managed to rub a bit of glue from the back of the tube onto the torn parts of the case before i discarded it.) try to pick it up - stuck...... shiiiiiiiit. my fucking phone is superglued to the countertop of the place i'm renting.

i managed to tear it off, leaving a big rubber skid where the glue made contact. tomorrow, i must google solutions for cleaning krazy-glue from the counter without damaging it. still haven't got the glue off my fingers. at least i successfully glued my case back together, although it has a weird patch on the back now.","tried to superglue my phone case, glue tube leaked all over, ended up inadvertently gluing phone case to the counter, buh-bye damage deposit, who cares, archer is awesome.**"
922,"so i wanted to see if this stuff actually worked. i applied it to my whole body, being a hairy human and all, but i think i kept it on past the required time. the fucking hair did not come off, even after scrubbing with my towel. 

that shit burns. unfortunately, some of it seeped into my crack, and it wasn't long before the itchy burning spread all over. 

so i then muscled through it, and decided to finish the rest by using this smooth and effective pink razor my mother keeps on the shelf. as i was finishing up my arms, i knocked both knuckles, the ones located on your wrists. 

as i got out it took about twenty fucking minutes to get them to both stop bleeding. 
so now i sit here with itchy nipples, an itchy ass, and two stinging but healing knuckles. tifu.","i gave myself all day itchiness in the worst of places, and cut myself by accident**"

i've lived in europe for the last three years and haven't been to one of my favorite stores ever since i moved. well one week into being in the states i'm walking through target holding a basket by the holes on the side rather than the handle. (imagine the basket as a comically oversized set of novelty brass knucks).

i try to slip my fingers out of the holes to grab something off a shelf and they wont come out.  eventually i get my pointer and ring finger out but my middle finger is still stuck. so my wife goes and gets a cart not really believing me that my hand is stuck and i walk around trying to nonchalantly get my finger out of the basket, which is now sitting in the cart. my wife gets me some sampler lotion from the makeup section and puts it on my finger. still won't budge. i get another idea and we go over to the travel-sized toiletry section and we pop open a small pack of baby oil. my finger is good and oiled by it still will not come out. at this point my finger is starting to turn blue and fat from constantly struggling to get out.

at this point i'm starting to give up on the idea of escaping this finger trap silently and i get the attention of a passing loss prevention officer. i go over all the things i tried and he suggets using some vaseline. so he's over here being a real bro and slathering my finger with vaseline. if i didn't need his help so badly i would have closed my eyes and licked my lips while he was rubbing vaseline up and down my finger to be funny...

anyway my finger still will not come loose.  so he tries to get a manager on the radio and it takes a long time for him to get to us. in the meantime people are starting to notice what's going on with me and yeah, people are openly laughing.

the manager finally shows up and suggests we call the fire department, i was really hoping it wouldn't come to this but it did. i ask if there's somewhere i can sit where i wont be such a spectacle and i get seated between the starbucks area and pharmacy and sit on a bench trying my best to pretend i'm just holding the basket when people walk by.

eventually the fire department arrives and they have to use medical scissors to cut all the rings around my finger to get me loose. they then cut one line through the ring my finger is in and i'm able to pull the whole thing apart with my hand.

my finger hurts and i love target so i'm going to have to face these people who know what a stupid man-child i am constantly.","local 27 year old man gets finger stuck in target basket, has to be cut out by fire dept."

926,"this happened today, my parents were going out and my girlfriend wanted to come over after our plans to go to her house had failed. my parents knew she was coming over, everything seems perfect, right? wrong. my cousin, who has been staying with us for the past 3 months, is also home in the living room and we are a room away in my room. 

cue sexy time. 

we decided to sneak upstairs and get it in, no sex though because we had heard a rustle downstairs, which i had concluded was my dog moving around in his room moving a barrier which prevents his from going upstairs. this terrified both of us so we go back downstairs, my cousin is in a position to see us so i try to pass it off as us trying to play with my dog.

not exactly sure whether he bought it or not but something peculiar caught me, i came back to my room, and my tv, which was previously on when we snuck up, was turned off. odd. i pass it off as me maybe turning it off, another thing though, the gate was in a weird position. weird.

cue extra paranoia, my sisters, both older than me by about 12 years are with my parents. i get a text from one of them that says this:

""be careful with what you do with your girlfriend, tell her i said hi""

weird, she had told me though before i better not have a girl alone at home though, i'm hoping that's all it is and my parents somehow may not have found out. my parents have thankfully avoided that talk with me and i don't plan on having it with them any time soon...

guess i'll see what happens when my parents come home in an hour.","had sexy time with girlfriend, parents might have found out. not looking forward to the consequences..."

929,"so, in order to understand my fuck up, a little back story.
 i started my second year at college (english, not american). sitting in a room with another course, my friend and i were looking at the malicious advice mallard meme, so said girl and i start chatting, before our groups are split back up.
 fast forward and both courses are on the same trip to the london museum of design. after an hour of drawing and such, i find the girl and we start talking again (still didn't know her name at this point). about 5 minutes later my friend, let's call him john, sits down with us and notices that we are similar, personality wise, so using his phone, tells me to ask her out. please bear in mind that an 18yo 15st male with no prior dating experience is writing here, so... yeah. anyway, back to the fuck up. so she walks off, looking for other members of her group to see if they want lunch or something. another friend joins us and john tells him all about it, so this other friend, lets say dan, walks off to find her and ask her for her number. for me.
 fuck. my. life.
 that was all that decided to streak through my head for the next half hour. anyway, me and friends go to get lunch, and before we are due to head back on the underground, i see her again. bear in mind she is like an 8/10 and i'm maybe a 4/10 in good lighting. anyway, me, being a complete idiot, does nothing, no talking. nothing. so yeah. just me. alone again.
  
 woo! first post!

update; so i saw the girl again (still don't know her name. still sucks) and i was with a few mates. now i don't know what your friends are like, but mine are assholes. she says hi and thanks to said asshole friends just not shutting the hell up i say 'hi' in the most awkward weird voice ever. so now i think that she thinks i'm some kind of special needs kinda guy.

930,"so my friends took my phone during study hall to text people. i didn't really care because they always do. so i went to sleep. they returned the phone to me at the end of the period and everything seemed fine.

after school, some big ass dude came up to me and started confronting me. he was like ""if you don't stop talking like that to my daughter, i'm going to report you to the police and the school."" i've never gotten in major trouble in school so of course i freaked the fuck out. turned out my friends sexted some girl from my phone. we knew each other's name, face, number, and nothing else. i apologized and told him it wasn't me but i think he didn't believe. pretty sure the girl will never talk to me again.",let friends have my phone during school. turned out they sexted some girl and i was confronted by her dad.
931,"okay so usually when we're together, my boyfriend and i spend most nights at his place. i still live with my family so it's just easier on everybody for us to have a place to ourselves. today though he came straight to my place after work and neither of us could really be bothered driving anymore. we just decided to hang out in my bedroom and re-watch some got.

we were snuggled up in bed together, and after an episode or two, we started making out a little, which quickly lead to the removal of clothing. a little while later we were getting pretty into it. we kept quiet of course, but it wasn't the softest sex we've ever had. 

all of a sudden, my dad knocked on the door. i quickly yelled ""hold on!"" but it was too late because the door was already swinging open. yeah, he's one of those people. i don't know what the fuck happened, but both me and my boyfriend just completely froze in position. it would've been slightly less disastrous if we'd pulled the covers over ourselves or something... *anything*, but nope, frozen doggy style and in full view. 

my dad half-stepped in and said ""there's beef and gra-""

eye contact.

fuck. i can't even describe the look that was on his face, though i'm sure it mirrored my own. absolute pure, unadulterated terror. it was probably only a second max, but it felt like a fucking eternity that everybody in the room was just completely frozen. after the second it took for him to wrap his mind around what he'd just walked in on he fled pretty fuckin' quick though. i heard his voice say ""...shit"" as he hurried back down the hallway. 

fuck's sake. i can't believe we didn't lock the door. my dad didn't talk to me for like 3 months when i first came out to him years ago, so i'm pretty sure we're never going to speak again now that he walked in on me balls deep in my boyfriend. 

needless to say, we did not finish, and we did not join my parents in the kitchen for some beef and gravy. we were both pretty keen to drive afterwards though because there was no fucking *way* we were staying at my house after that.

i plan to stay at my boyfriend's place until he's absolutely sick of me to the point of it potentially ruining our relationship. i'm just not sure i can ever look my dad in the eye again without experiencing terrible flashbacks.","made eye contact with my slightly homophobic father while i was balls deep in my boyfriend. terror, so much terror."
932,"(this actually happened several years ago, but i am still laughing at this experience). 

it was a hot summer day back in high school. hormones were raging, and me and my boyfriend were looking for a place to get sexy. we finally found a place down what we thought was not a well traveled trail. just to be safe we wandered about 10 yards off the trail, then things started getting hot and sweaty. then, i start getting licked by not one, but two dogs. i hear an old women shriek, and realize ""oh cool, this trail is more well traveled than we thought"" as i make eye contact with an elderly man and woman innocently out waling their dogs. of course, at that exact moment, my boyfriends looses it. he's orgasming, i'm trying my best to camouflage into the forest undergrowth, the old man is snickering, and the old lady looks like she was having a myocardial infarction.

i began to wake up with a slight but sharp pain coming from toes, moving from toe to toe like some little pin pricks, after a few seconds of this i was wide awake and instinctively wanted to find out what the hell this was so i sat up in the fashion of a horror movie and in doing so, sat up so fast and jerked my head forward with such enthusiasm that i ripped a muscle in my neck and immediately fell back down in excruciating pain. i've broken a few bones in my time and i thought in my still half asleep pain filled brain that i had broken my neck or at least shaved a section off of a cervical vertebrae. before i go any further i should mention that it was my cat biting my toes which were dangling blissfully from the end of my bed, anyways... 

i put to rest the idea that i had broken something as i didn't have any change of sensation in my limbs and decided to sleep it off, so i lay absolutely still for the next 12 hours. until i had to get up and go get ready/ go for a piss. boom! i could not possibly move for the pain, i was paralysed by it, fuck i thought as i lay there in my (quite comfy) bed. after a good 20 minutes of trying i manned up, gritted my teeth and threw my self out of bed and immediately fell to my knees in pain.

after a quick thought of what would reddit say i threw on some clothes, chewed a couple of mints, meandered slowly to the landline and called a taxi to take me to hospital and gingerly walked outside like a 1950's sci-fi robot, being completely unable to move my upper body for fear of excruciating pain. after 3 hours of ridiculous pain and tedium i was seen by a doctor and was given some codeine, ibuprofen & paracetamol and told its gonna get worse before it gets better and essentially to suck it up.

it's 18 hours from the even and i still can't move my head in any meaningful fashion. today was not a good day.","woke up, sat up, ripped neck from the inside, pain like a broken bone :/"

well fast forward to after i've been screaming obscenities at the players on the field for about 20 minutes (so so subtle), i decide its high time to make a run to the bathroom, so without thinking to have a friend join me in navigating the sea of people between the concession stand and myself, i just stumble carelessly through hordes of bodies, incoherent to the frustration of these people. 
so i suppose i looked a bit suspicious during this trip and immediately after i resumed my place in the stands to scream like a jackass i feel a tap on my shoulder. i turn around to find myself about 18 inches from my principle's face along with a police officer. they proceed to ask me to recite the alphabet, where i slur the tune, ""a b c d e f g... w x y z""
so next thing i know i'm sitting across from my principal, who is on the phone with my crying mother, and in one final apex of self-loathing i projectile vomit onto the floor and desk of my principal, who screams into the phone in surprise to my mother. 
i passed out in the car on the way home and just stayed there until i woke up about 5 hours later.",i got fucked up for a soccer game and projectile vomited all over my principle's office
943,"so, i have this chilli plant in my kitchen, and these bastards are hot. the day i bought it i tried one just as i was about to drive home. it blew my face off and i felt like i was driving drunk. when ever i use them, i have to scrape the seeds out...unless i want nuclear food. i once chopped one up, didn't wash my hands properly, and later that evening i rubbed my eye. it straight up felt like my eye was melting.

last night i cooked some dinner for my so and i, and included a chopped up chilli. now, i did wash my hands, but failed to properly scrub with the nail brush to get all the capsicum off.

fast forward to naked time with the gf...

""is there something on your fingers?""

""no, why?""

""something stings""

""ah....""",i accidentally chilli fingered my girlfriend.
944,"so today as i was mowing the grass at my house (note: i live on a lake with a large hill leading into it) i began like any other time by putting in my ipod.  i finished the top half of the yard and was moving onto the hill oblivious to everything when suddenly my legs began to feel wet. i looked down(mower still running) and realized i had annihilated a big bullfrog. mortified, i then tried to hurry down the hill mowing when i slipped in the remains of the frog.  as i was falling forward i pushed the new mower into the lake.","i mowed a bullfrog, fell down a hill and drowned my new lawnmower."
945,"alright so i'm in spanish class and the girl who sits next to me is a very open lesbian (not that i have any problem with that we're actually pretty friendly)
so she began talking to me about her homosexual relationship problems, and as i'm just sitting there listening to her, and in a blaze of absent minded ignorance i blurt out ""gosh, that is soooo gay"" 
needless to say she went berserk and made me feel like the most bigoted ignorant jackass (which i probably am) while the entire class just grilleddddd me.",i told a lesbian her relationship problems were gay
946,"so i got home and the window cleaners were in the neighbourhood. i really needed a piss, so as soon as the guy had been paid i went upstairs to the bathroom to relieve myself. the blinds were open (you can see where this is going), but i thought; ""meh, he'll start downstairs at the front"" and besides the it's that kind of warped glass that distorts the light so you can't see through clearly. 30 seconds later, and i saw nothing other than the window cleaner's ladder appear outside, and heard footsteps on the rungs. the floodgates were open; there was no way i was holding back this piss. i decided to frantically try and close the blinds instead (the toilet is right next to the window). this was where the shit hit the fan. about the worst posssible thing happened: the blind cord jammed halfway, and as i struggled desperately with the cord my trousers (that would be pants) fell down as the guy's head appeared outside. in a last ditch effort to preserve my dignity, i dropped to the ground, and spent the next minute or so hiding under the sink in shame with my trousers around my legs to the sound of them laughing and taking the ladder down before deciding to start somewhere else. oh, and i got piss all over my socks.","couldn't hold in a piss, blinds got stuck, window cleaner saw my dick, hid under the sink in shame."
947,"long day of teaching was finally out of the way and i decided to hop in the shower before correcting. i get in the shower and everything is going swell. arms: check. legs: check. downtown: check. my uptown girls: check. then i go to shave. i grab the razor in a haphazard motion from the ledge and quickly bring my arm back across my body. i felt a tinge, but i ignored it at first thinking i was wrong. so i shaved some and then i looked down and my worst idea had happened: i nicked my nipple with the razor. blood was everywhere. i literally shaved off the skin from one side of my nipple by being a little overzealous with a razor in my worn-out state. in my panic, i somehow coaxed it to stop bleeding so much. thinking i was a genius, i decided to masturbate. i had to stop because the force i often use when i get down to business opened up the wound and blood was dripping on my arm the whole time from my nipple. apparently, nipple blood isn't a fetish of mine.",: til nipples bleed profusely.
948,"so today in my highschool chemistry class we had an lab to do. so last night i emailed my teacher and asked if, just to be silly, i could bring in a gas mask to wear instead of safety glasses. she emails me back and gives me the ok as long as i don't wear it outside of the classroom.
here we are to this morning. now my day starts at a prompt 6:30 am and i get to school at 7:30 am even though it starts at 9:00 am because my parents are busy people. so when they let us in the building they put us in the cafeteria to wait for school to start because it's regulation. somewhere between that time and my 11:45 chemistry class i left the can shaped filter that screws onto the mask in the cafeteria. (i think it just dropped out or something) anyways so at about 10:30 i get called out of class to go to the on campus police officer's office, more commonly referred to as op. apparently they found the canister in the cafeteria and thought it was part of a bomb. of course it had my name on it in giant ass yellow letters so i couldn't deny it was mine. 
once i arrive at op's office after being escorted by two other cops i had never seen before i get put in a chair and they search my bag. they find the usual papers, pens, gameboy, and then... gas mask. they look at me then back at the mask and ask where the bomb was. it took me the entirety of 10 minutes to convince them there was no bomb and that was the filter to the mask. once the bomb fuss is over, they wonder why the hell i brought a gas mask to school. i believe the exact question was, ""what in the power of zeus would put the idea in your head to bring this?""
after explaining it to them and showing them the email i get a prompt apology i am given a high five for, ""being awesome enough to own a gas mask"" and returned to class. all in time to scare the crap out of my chem. class with the gas mask. but, they gave me the can filter back after school because they didn't want someone else thinking it was a bomb.

949,"so long time lurker first time poster. not really the worst fuck up but it sucked nonetheless.

i recently got a laptop and have been using it for about a week or so. now i have been having the same occurring problem where my internet connection would go from private to public on its own causing my internet to disconnect.

  after much frustration and days of google searching and trying to fix it i decided to just call tech support. after a few minutes of talking the it guy said that the best thing to do was to reset my computer to factory setting. ""ok"" i though, this computer is only a week old how so i don't have anything important on it. so i restore it and continue on with my day and as i'm browsing the web it fucking hits me. 

 i had a four page essay on my laptop that is due tomorrow and my resume which i worked my ass off to make. so now here i am typing this story after redoing my essay (which is shit compared to the first draft) and just overall in a shitty mood.",i should really check before deleting everything on my computer.
950,"**-tl;dr at the end-**

i left some eggs to boil and forgot about them for 2 hours because i was playing gta san andreas. i started to smell something burning but for some reason didn't get up. i was upstairs, and i was home alone, so somehow my initial thought was that the neighbors had fucked up a barbecue. so i *closed my goddamn window*. two hours had passed and i finally figured it was something inside my house. i got up, got out of my room and see that the entire house is full of smoke. visibility is about 90%. the smell of burnt *something* is filling the house and i run downstairs, half expecting to see a growing fire in my living room. thankfully it's just the eggs, and i was able to open up all the doors and windows as well as turn on all the fans while simultaneously running through the house fanning smoke out with a big dry-erase board. 

all the windows and doors had been closed previously, so if i had taken the nap i had planned to take, who knows if i would've woken up?

the moral of the story is... set a damn timer on your eggs.","left eggs on the stove for two hours, almost died of smoke inhalation. all because i was preoccupied playing gta**"
951,"so this weekend i went to a water park. i wore 100 spf sunblock and reapplied it mid-day (i never stayed wet and i never toweled off so usually i am fine). 

now i am very, very pale. i am as white as they get. i wear the hell out of sunscreen and always have a bottle on me. 

yesterday i had sun poisoning. pain, nausea, joint pain, blurred vision. all the normal things that happen when i spend a day in the sun. i actually had planned for it. it's like a sun hang over. 

i knew my back was a little burnt because my shirt hurts to wear. so this morning i decided to exfoliate-toner-moisturize. i always do that when i get too much sun and it works. now i can't see my back. my mirror is off the wall while my vanity is being replaced. 

so i grab my back brush, a soft brush with a handle and start. ahhhhhh oh god the pain. it was like i had a wire brush against my back. the sort you use for grills. that is what it felt like. 

i rinsed it off with cool water and the pain mostly subsided. 

so i get out of the cold shower and washed my face. i used the toner and tossed a bit on a soft rag. i contorted my arms to do my back. toner usually helps cool sunburns for me. no idea why, but it also helps the moisturizer absorb. 

not today. it was like i was dripping hot metal down my back or candle wax. i fell on the floor and just had to breathe. it was the worst pain i've felt in my life. 

so i finally get up and gently moisturize. i decide to look in the mirror at work.

yeah my back is bloody. it has cuts in it probably from the soft back brush. my skin is ruined. it's going to look like i was victim of a flaying for the rest of my life.

additionally, my computer chair at work goes up past my head so it is touching all day. 

on the plus side, if this doesn't give me skin cancer nothing will.","; sun poisoning, skin is broken and bloody. put toner and moisturizer on it. feels bad. rest of me is ghost-white."
952,"so this way yesterday but never mind. 

sunday july 16th and i set my alarm for 6:00am. got up and ready for airsoft at my local centre. all is good feeling great and refreshed but could tell a cold was coming along. :(

got dressed. i knew it was going to be a hot day so i planned my clothing accordingly - wicking shirt and running bottoms to keep the sweat off me. olive army shirt and army trousers, socks, boots and hoodie and to be tactical put on my chest rig. wanted to look awesome too so i put on my skull face balaclava and wore a cap. 

got there for 9:25 am.

got kitted up with the guns and had a briefing. had a 500ml bottle of water. wasn't enough.

by 10:30 am it was beginning to get really warm and my hoodie was keeping the moisture in. starting to get pools of sweat inside my googles. couldn't see a thing, kept getting shot! was playing like a child.

we lost - because of me. fuck.

it gets to 11:30 am and i was beginning to feel slightly nauseated. not good. went to the car for some shade and a break. had another two bottles of water. sun was blaring down on me like satans curry shits.

put the ac on in the car. still to warm, sat in just my tee shirt. not good enough. told my team that i wasn't feeling well. thought it could be due to hunger, ate 2 hot dogs. not hunger, starting to feel sick. stayed in the car another hour whilst everyone was playing and kicking the fuck out of each other. 

1:30 pm. threw my fucking guts out like the ganges on laundry day. 

felt sort of ok, decided to play again, had a kit kat to boost my sugar, had another 3 bottles of water.

still not enough,

threw up again 10 minutes into playing. went back to the car

slept in the shade, felt ok

driving home and i was feeling really fucking sick. again!

pulled over. threw up all over the road. managed to get some of it into a bag.

got home and took a cold bath, slept in the bath, woke up and threw up in the water. sat in my own diluted puke and couldn't give a shit. felt like fucking death.

turn out i ended up getting heat stroke by wearing to many layers,

(today - monday 15th july) 

feeling sort of ok. went to work today, throat feels like i took a fist to the neck and my head feels like its been smacked with a hammer.","played airsoft in 30 degree heat, wore too many layers because i was a pussy. didn't drink enough. causing me to get heat stroke. this causing me to throw up 4 times in the space of 3 hours! not good :("
953,"i swear... i have the worst luck in the world.

ok, i'm tired, and i have a doppler in a couple hours. i'm not gonna do my usual wall of text. just a short post this time.

----------------------------

so i'm watching episode 17 of black butler. [the episode, if you're interested](http://www.dubbedonline.com/black-butler-episode-17-english-dub)

i reach a... fun part... and my dad walks in to show me a guitar i might like. *the yamaha 012 pacifica, light blue. i love it* 

he sees the screen and simply says ""the fuck kind of porn are you watching?"" and walks out.

knowing him, there's no doubt he told the rest of my family just to be an asshole.

**fun. now my whole family probably thinks i watch hentai.**

954,"this actually happened a couple weeks ago, but i didn't even realize this subreddit existed. here's the story:

i (used to) work at popular pizza chain as a delivery driver. we get requests on receipts all the time, draw this, write a joke, write your favorite song, etc.

well, i had already clocked for the day and was bagging an order before i left. i noticed the ticket said ""??"" in the note line, and i thought ""reminds me of the riddler.. i should write a riddle!"" so i wrote the first one that came to mind, the classic ""a rich man needs it, a poor man has it in excess, but if you eat me you'll surely die."" the answer of course being ""nothing""

here's the part that in hindsight i could've done better with (besides that riddle in the first place), i put each part of the riddle on a seperate box, so the last one had the ""if you'll eat me you'll surely die"" bit.

well, the customer got her order, and her children promptly freaked out, which freaked her out. she took pictures of the boxes, sent those to corporate, and the following day at work my manager sat me down to say, ""this was a dumb choice, and it has a terrible outcome."" after calling his boss, i got fired outright.

 

edit: would like to point out that the tl;dr is kind of misleading. i realize it was my fault for having written the riddle on there in the first place, and in the end, it's on me for getting fired. i kinda thought that was implied by the fact that i was posting to tifu though. 

tl;dr2 - it was my fault, i know. just never would have thought a riddle would get me fired.

edit2: just got myself a new job and i start tomorrow! will not be writing anything on anyone's stuff ever again x.x",got fired because people don't understand a good riddle
955,"well, it did not happen today, but a few months ago while on safari in maasai mara gamepark in kenya. 

we had gone on a game drive into the wilderness. at one point we parked the van and went out to do a little bit of exploring. i wandered furthest and got to this tree which had an odd-looking object hanging high above on one of its branches. curiosity got the better of me so i picked a rock and hurled it at the 'object'. it dislodged and came tumbling down, hit the ground about 12 feet away from me and burst into a large ball of wild african bees. the loud buzzing sound was more than enough of a warning that i was about to be devoured by the [angriest and meanest bees in the whole world.]( http://phoenix.about.com/cs/desert/a/killerbees01.htm) instinctively i turned, ready to sprint back to the safety of the van before the bees could catch up with me. 

about 20 feet from the van, i tripped and fell face first, onto a large nest of red ants. didn't have time to wipe them of my face since i knew the bees would cause a lot more damage if they caught up. my friends had already reached the van and were holding the door for me to jump in and then seal it. i managed to get in but two bees caught up and stung me on the side of the neck and my ear. 

i don't know what hurt more, the numerous ants that i was trying to wipe of my face, or the sting on my neck and ear. so there i was, with a large swollen face, one ear larger than the other and a huge bump on my neck. my friends were having a seizure from laughing.

edit: paragraphs to reduce the eyesore.",i broke a beehive in the wilderness and fell on red ants while trying to get away from the bees.
956,"this was about a month ago, but please don't hold that against me.    
     
    
      
i was alone in my girlfriend's home a while she was off at work. i was rummaging through her bathroom drawers for some fingernail clippers when i came across her bottle of [nair hair removal lotion](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ljrjqo2egdc/tkh9ciww99i/aaaaaaaab08/fzepqadydsm/s1600/nair-neat-hair-removal-vintage-retro.jpg).     
      
i was curious, so i went for it. i applied a fuckload of nair all over my junk, my balls and pubes were completely coated in the stuff. and for good measure, i made sure to get it in my asshole to get the hair out of there too. i had been meaning to groom down there for some time, and my pubes were starting to get pretty unruly.     
       
i knew the basics of how nair worked. lather it on there. wait. wipe it off. no need to look at silly directions, right?        
       
i just assumed the longer and thicker your hair was, the longer the nair would need to take. so i sat there, butt naked on my girlfriend's toilet. i brought my laptop in with me. i watched an episode of adventure time. i could smell the hair starting to burn, but i just assumed that was supposed to happen, since it is a cream that melts your hair off.     
      
i watched another episode of adventure time. then another. then another.     
      
by that time, my nether regions were really starting to sting, so i assumed we were getting towards the end of the nair process.     
       
i watched one more episode.     
       
i sat there for five episodes of adventure time, almost a whole hour with nair lathered all over my junk.       
      
it was now really starting to hurt.     
     
i wet a towel with warm water and wiped it across my skin.     
       
what happened next was possibly the most excruciating pain i think i've ever felt in my life.      
      
i saw red for a second and fell off the toilet, onto the floor. i looked at the towel. i shouldn't have looked. what i saw was a giant smear of hair, skin, and blood.    
     
it hurt so fucking bad, and the worst part was there really was not time to grieve, because i knew that i needed to get the rest of the nair off of my skin before it got even worse, so i tried to dab the towel ever so lightly on my bleeding junk. it hurt just as bad.    
      
in agony, i limped into the shower. i thought, maybe if i turn the shower on a really soft setting with cold water.     
      
that didn't fucking work. each drop on my skin felt like daggers, but i had no other choice. i laid in the shower on my back with my legs above my head, so my asshole and dick could get all the water.      
       
i cried. i cried the whole time. i was literally laying on my back while hair, skin, and blood melted off of me.      
        
i eventually got the strength to get out of the shower and lie on the floor of the bathroom. i laid there with my eyes closed for what felt like forever. eventually my nether regions started to blister and puss. i knew at that point i had fucked up big time.     
      
i called my gf, told her what happened. at first she laughed, but i told her she needed to take me to a doctor immediately. when she saw the damage, she wasn't laughing anymore.     
       
she took me to a ready clinic, while i laid in the backseat with a towel gingerly wrapped around my body. we got to the clinic, and after the most awkward and painful doctor's visit of my life, they put some sort of healing cream type thing on me, which stung at first but eventually made the pain go away, and wrapped me up, like a baby wearing a fucking diaper.      
          
       

** 
   
    
edit: since a lot of people are asking, yes, my penis is all better now. i basically wore a diaper for a few weeks,  and then followed by boxers and basketball shorts only for a few more weeks. it was a grueling, painful, sex free, six weeks. and as dumb as it sounds, i got really lucky as far as injuries go. i have no nerve damage, very light and not horribly disfiguring scarring, and there are only two or three really tiny dime size patches of skin where the hair won't grow back.",i used nair and got second degree chemical burns all over my nether regions.**
957,"**warning**: extreme stupidity, autism, bipolar and dumbassry.

before you say i am a completely retarded dumbass, i am very well aware of this and i wish i could go back in time and maul myself to death.

it was a bit special wednesday because i couldn't access my computer 2 days prior to that and here i am, excited and ready to use the shit out of my computer when suddenly it bsods. when i try to start it, it gave some beep codes which wasn't listed in the official beep code list. i was like ""god dammit"" and decided to be superrepairman!

keep in mind, i have no fucking clue about computers other than basics. i know what the mobo does, what the cpu does etc. but nothing advanced and nothing that should excuse me into opening the heatsink.

while internally, i was aware it's a memory problem and the most logical step was to wait until tommorow and call my merchant and ask for a replacement (warranty).

but nope, i was full on retarded mode and decided in a hulk-voice ""i want play now!!!!!!!!!111"".
i then carefully placed the computer's sides upwards so i could get a good look. what seemed like a cautious way of handling the computer was followed by me going rambo on the heatsink fan, i couldn't figure out how to unlock the metal bars (am3 slot) and i proceed to use brute force on that shit.

then, what happens next was that my heatsink wouldn't come off. it was around 3 years since i had to take off my heatsink so i was like ""hmm, i don't remember if it's supposed to do this or ***not***""

i then proceed to brute force the heatsink. guess what happens! the **goddamn** ***cpu*** **chip** came off with it! 

i didn't notice this at first, i was like ""oh, this is totally normal, moving on!"". i then look at the mobo's cpu socket and i found no cpu. i was so fucking retarded atthat moment i had the nerves to think 

""wait what?... there's on cpu in here... uhhh what the hell could this mean?.... wait! does this mean that i had been using the computer with no cpu this whole time?!""

but fortunately i was not that retarded, i shook it off and found out the cpu chip was in fact **glued** to the heatsink. this was obviously probably because i had poor thermalpaste placement, so i proceed to brute force the cpu off which resulted in the edge being bended. you should of seen when i seperated the cpu and the heatsink. 

i used a pen's other end and started to use it like a crowbar between the cpu and the heatsink (it had a small gap) and then **fuckin' bam** the cpu chip came off and proceeded to land on the ground with a clear *chink* noise while it hit the ground. imagine a small tiny jewel being polished by a blacksmith when he's trying to make a greatsword goddammit. 

i then pick it up, and luckily no visible damage was done except the edge bended because i had used a pen-crowbar to seperate it from the heatsink. i put it in the socket, and then i put the heatsink over, then i proceed to lock in the metal bars on the heatsink.... but guess what? i didn't properly **put the cpu in the socket**, but i didn't realize that. so here is me trying to brute force the **fuck** out of the metal bars while my cpu chip's pins was getting bended.

it took around 5 minutes until i gave up and took a look at the cpu chip itself. also, before i did this, if you know the metal lock for the cpu socket, when i took out the cpu heatsink the cpu chip was also attached to it. big red flag right here, but i was so oblivious and retarded i thought it was normal until a bit later. the socket lock was also not unlocked, which was a very big red flag.

i then noticed the cpu pins bent, so i grabbed a pen and started to go on craftsmen and readjust it. instead of using a long object to properly adjust them i use a fucking pen. after that's done, i put it in and proceed to properly lock the heatsink. 

after all that is done, i turn it back on. surprisingly, it still worked but it still had the same problem. so in conclusion, i basically probably permanently damaged my cpu, mobo, case when in the end it was all a memory problem.",i performed a vivisection on my computer thinking i was fixing it.
958,"some background: i had been trying to find a first job as a teenager for a month before i got hired as a host. 

anyways, i arrive at the restaurant a few minutes early for training. i meet the manager, some coworkers, everything is going great so far. it was a lot of information to learn for the first day, but luckily it wasn't too busy. 

my shift was about to end when i messed up hard. after i cleaned a table, i went to get napkins and utensils to set onto the table. the thing is, i pulled the tray out with too much force and completely underestimated the weight of the utensils. the tray slipped out of my hands; forks, knives and spoons just poured like rain onto the floor. the sound of  all the metal hitting the floor was deafening and caused a huge ruckus. 
 
my face flushing red, there was nothing i could do but pick up all the utensils on the floor, which amounted to about 3/4 ths of the supply, and send them to the back for the dishwasher to clean them. all the diners simply looked at me with a mix of condescending sympathy (or maybe disdain) during my moment of horrendous embarrassment. 

luckily, the manager wasn't there to witness the hilarity. only my coworkers saw; i must seem like a complete idiot to them, screwing up so hard on the first day. 

a rough start for my very first day of work ever. 

 

serious question: is this even forgivable? i'm not trying to pull the ""it's my first day card"" but i don't want to be fired either after only one day.","first day of work, spilled utensils all over floor making a huge scene."
959,"so i had my driving test today and long story short, i failed because of a left hand turn. anyways, during the test, i was making a 3-point turn but hit the curb with the hubcap. the examiner told me i didn't fail the test because of that but, i was so thrown off after that, i pretty much bombed the test, and afterwards when i told my instructor that i failed, he drove me home and that was it. i realized afterwards that i forgot to tell him what i did when i looked at my phone later in the day and he left me a voicemail telling me to call him back. i'm pretty scared to call him back because i think he's gonna accuse me of purposefully not telling him, plus my father thinks i don't need the instructor's car anyways for my next attempt at the test. fuck maybe it's not too big of a fuck up but i feel pretty ashamed.","today i failed my driving test, then forgot about the curb i hit with the hubcap of instructor's car, and failed to tell him."

961,"so the so and i are in ecuador on vacation and we are flying out to panama city and 6 am the following morning. we've been on a bit of a day drunk and he's tired and i'm bored. i decide to wander off to an internet cafe where i end up meeting some fun travellers and we head off to a bar. we drink more and more.. and more. fast forward i'm stumbling around and i can't find the condo we are renting for the life of me. i'm trying to ask around my spanish is lousy and slurring. eventually so finds me outside a block away and he is pissed! rightly so. it is 2am. we discover i've lost my iphone. it has all my vacation pics and some nudie pics of me on it...we head back and we go to sleep for a bit after a lot of yelling. we sleep a little late as we're hungover and he sends me down to ask the doorman to call us a cab. i assume because of my terrible spanish he doesn't. the airport is an hour away. the so manages to get us a cab called after we wait awhile but by the time we get to the airport it's 15 minutes before departure so we can't leave. they also do not sell tickets to panama at the airport. we have to take another cab all the way back and then i manage to find tickets for oh, only $500 each for the 1.5 hour flight. several hours later we head back to airport.  when we get home to canada i discover $1100 in fraudulent charges have accrued on my phone despite my reporting it stolen.","tifu by getting drunk, missing my flight, adding another $2500 onto my vacation expenses and scaring my so. fml."
962,"before you ask, yes i am the same person that posted the doritos locos dog shit catastrophe the other day. i thought that was the end of the fuck ups. but the fates jest, and this one is much more terrifying, but only slighlty less disgusting. let us begin.

today i was still recovering for the doritos locos diarrhea shit storm my dog violently ejaculated from his asshole onto my face while sleeping. me and teddy have a rocky relationship at best at the moment. today i thought, ""well at least getting dog diarrhea blasted all over your head is probably the lowest you can go, i guess things cant get much worse."" well i didn't have the faintest idea of the horrific showdown that will occur in approximately 12 hours.  the day was great! i did some hoodrat shit with my friends, ""watched"" despicable me 2 with my date. and by watch i mean violating her tounge with my own while a movie plays in the background. and then we had some ""lunch"" and by lunch i mean we oraly pleasured eachothers fuck instrument.  sounds like a pretty solid day right?  well let us fast forward shall we?


12:00 am. just finished watching family guy on netflix. ""time to go to bed"" i sleepily grumble to myself. i enter my room, and i was unaware of the monstrosity lurking above me on my ceiling. i get in my bed and out of the corner of my eye, i see a mother fucking moth the size of a fucking gi joe. i am paralyzed from the dick down as i see my imminent demise staring me down from my ceiling.  ok so this thing is so fucking big that there is no way in fuck i am killing it, the bug sauce would be too much to clean up. so i opt for the more jesus like response.... i'm saving this mother fucker.  i find a hawk feather. (i have no fucking idea why a hawk feather was so readily available) and try to coerce it onto the feather. i gently rub the insect with the feathers trying to show that i am no enemy. but the stupid fucker keeps getting more and more agressive with each sexual stroke i give it. eventually its going full on kamikaze on my ass. this goes on for about an hour. eventually i get frustrated that something could be so inconceiviabley retarded that i borderline think about assassinating it with my rubber band gun. (yet again i don't know why or where it came from.  it was just there) i just say fuck it, and leave the winged demon for morning. i get in bed with teddy... i forgave him :), and get to sleep. now here comes the gross part.


i wake up to a tickle on my face. i instinctively go and scratch it like any normal humanoid would do. i find out moments later this will be the most disgusting scratch of my life. i scratch it, then i start to feel something slapping the fuck out of my nose. moments later i realize its the moth.... or what was left of it.  while scratching, i squished the moth on my face and it was squirming out of agony.  i had bug juice all over my cheek and nose. i ran to my bathroom and looked in the mirror and saw awfulness. there was yellowish white goo all over my cheek, a leg or two and part of a wing.  my face looked like the aftermath of a bug versus lamborghini head on collision.  the smell could only be described as ratchet. i get in the shower and wash up, scrape the bug off the bed and fontemplate suicide. not as big of a fuck up as the other day, but still a pretty big fuck up. just kill the damn thing next time jadinklagemorgoone!.

963,"ok so this wasn't exactly today but encompasses my whole last week.

i was fairly sick and stuck with one of the worst sore throats i've had in a long while; unfortunately for me it wasn't strep throat so i couldn't just take an antibiotic and be done with it. so this sore throat makes it feel like i'm swallowing glass, and because of this i have literally no appetite. over the course of 3 days i only ate 3 cans of chicken noodle soup that were about 70 calories a piece, and even that hurt like pouring molten lead down my throat.

to make matters worse... i had explosive diarrhea. 

i spent 3 horrendous days not trusting any fart as far as i could throw it and rushing to the restroom every couple of minutes. but because i had no appetite and wasn't eating any food at all i was shitting blanks, sitting on the toilet with massive cramps and a few squirts every few minutes. by the end of the third day my asshole was redder than a raspberry and more raw than eddie murphy's 1987 stand up comedy movie. the mix of both this and my sore throat made it really difficult to sleep and rarely got more than a few hours a night. all around, things were not exactly pleasant.

the only thing i had to make life bearable was tea. since i was shitting out all of the 70% of liquid my body had, i had to constantly be drinking and luckily for me i found a few days prior that a nice warm cup of tea actually felt pretty good. i drank so much tea that i ended up finishing half a box of some menthe tea and a whole box of my parents diet green tea. i'm a big fan of green tea so i finished that box within 3 days. 

as i'm throwing away the box of diet green tea, i start to think. how can tea get any more diet? it's just tea leaves and hot water... i looked at the box again to find that it actually read dieter's green tea prompting me to look at the back of the box where in semi bold letters it reads, ""this tea contains laxative properties. do not exceed more than 2 cups within 24 hours."" i finished a box of 20 tea bags using a 20oz mug for each bag in only 3 days... i was giving myself explosive diarrhea. i was to blame for the 3 excruciating days of shit coated pain.",*i put myself into a shit induced coma that lasted 3 days because i drank laxative infused tea.*
964,"before anyone says anything: yes, i know. eating mcdonald's in general is a fuck up. but i tell you, the fuck up transcends just shitty food.

i went to the fast food eatery that happily serves 42 million people globally every day. it was a hot day in the south, so i decided to get my something to cool me off. a strawberry banana smoothie. sounds amazing, right? well i was hungry too. got 2 hot & spicy sandwiches because fuck, they're a dollar a piece. no big deal. i consume both and go about my way.

fast forward several hours and i'm in wal-mart with my girlfriend and we are perusing around the grocery section when i feel the first sign of ""oh fuck, i have to use the bathroom soon"". so i say ""hey, let's go by the movies and look around."" i walked into the dvd section that had all the tv series collections and, wanting to get into game of thrones, decided to see how much the 1st and 2nd season cost.

$35 a piece. for 10 episodes a season. ""fuck, this is going to be an expensive little bit of catching up i'm gonna be doi-""


and at that moment, tragedy struck. the urge to shit reached critical mass and i made a bee line to the bathroom where the most fiery, painful liquid-esque shit i've ever produced in my entire life poured from my nether regions. it literally burned for the next 2-3 hours or so. i walk out with a waddle in my step and my girlfriend asks, ""are you okay?""

""i'm wonderful.""

 

good news though, my girlfriend's mother felt sorry for me after she heard the story and bought me season 1 of game of thrones. excellent!

edit: bee line","ate the worst possible combination of food from mcd's, a smootie and 2 hot and spicy sandwiches. painful fiery shit ensued."
965,"to start, i had bv. i go to the doc, and she prescribes me an antibiotic by the name of ""flagyl."" like a responsible lady who doesn't like to post too much on /r/tifu, i read all the instructions and look it up some more on the internet so i can understand the mechanism of action and possible side effects. i see that flagyl sometimes causes yeast infections. well that kinda sucks, but i guess i'll just keep an eye out for it. after i have been taking it for three days and the bv itching i had is gone (but i am not done with the course of flagyl), and i google what a yeast infection looks like. i then proceed to spread my pussy lips and look down. i see something resembling a white film, but nothing google-worthy. later, my boyfriend comes over and i tell him about it. since he obviously has a much better view than i do, i show it to him and ask him if he'd be down to have sex tonight and if he thinks i should talk to a doctor. i spread my pussy lips at him and he takes a look. without changing his tone or expression at all, he looks back up at my face and says ""i think you should go to the doctor tomorrow, and i don't think we should have sex tonight."" i was very surprised. i even argued ""but dude, it's not bothering me, and it is just a little bit of white stuff."" he says ""i think you need a mirror or something. i think it is worse than you realize."" i use my webcam to check it out on my computer screen and immediately regret it. there is like big, thick, cottage-cheese-ish lumps filling up the lips. i have no clue how i couldn't feel it. if i saw it on google, i would think ""*how* does anybody let it get that bad?!"" he was very nice and it didn't seem to bother him as much as it did me, but seriously, he didn't need to see that. *i* could have done without it too. off to the doctor today :-d

 

update: so it was indeed yeast. got me some drugs to fix it, and i'll take your advice and take a probiotic too + eat lots of yogurt. also, you guys are hilarious. i have never got even a third of this much karma for anything i have ever posted before. reddit is a strange place.","i ask my boyfriend if something minor was worth going to the doc over, he sees two tablespoons of white sludge.**"
966,"so this actually happened over last summer, but i actually didn't realize what i had done until about a week ago. basically, i was in china with some other students from the us, and we would get some alcohol every night while we were there and have a good time. the entire trip there was a girl from ohio who had been hitting on me, but i didn't know how to make a move.


now the final night comes along, and we all decided to drink a little more than usual, which led to us smoking tea-leaf-cigars and playing tug-of-war on the roof with a pipe we found while it was pouring rain. eventually, my friend slips, face plants on the tile roof at 2 in the morning, and stands up to reveal the nastiest goose egg i have ever seen. it literally looked like he had an actual egg under his skin on his forehead, so, since i was drunk, i panicked, carried him inside, gave him to my more sober friend, then proceeded to sprint around the building in terror until i realized my more sober friend had taken him to our room and he was sleeping. 


the only problem was now i didn't have a bed to sleep in. so, the girl from ohio and her friend had a room with two beds, and she offered for my more sober friend and i to stay in their rooms that night. 


soon enough, the girl from ohio and i are making out in one bed while my friend is with her friend in the other. we're under the covers, things are getting pretty heated, and then she asks:


""it's kind of hot in here, don't you want to take your clothes off?"" 


now here's the kicker, i was so drunk that i thought for a moment, then said:


""...i'm not really that hot, so i'm fine. thanks for offering though."" 


yeah. so the night ends with us falling asleep next to each other after kissing for awhile, and that is how i fucked up. i literally did a face palm when i thought back to that and realized what i had (not) done. on the bright side it's still an awesome story. 


oh and my friend is fine. he just had a huge bump on his head for a few days.","girl and i are making out in a bed in china, she says it's hot so i should take my clothes off and i say i'm not hot, but thanks for offering."
967,"today i was on my way to a session with a sub of mine, and the following happened:

i'm visually impaired and can't drive, so i'm stuck taking the bus.  there was half an hour before my bus came, and i was kind of hungry, so i decided to make a trip to the local grocery store.  i just wanted a sandwich, so i didn't bother with a cart going in.

well, i ended up buying more than i anticipated; some of my favorite desserts were on sale, and because i didn't get a cart, i put them in my bag with my toys.

i went to check out, and because i still made it under the '15 items or less' limit, i used that stand.  without conveyor belts.

so i go up, we exchange pleasantries, and i unpack my own stuff.

>cashier: oh, you brought your own bag?  i'll give you your bag credit, then.

>me: er, bag credit?

>c: yeah, it's our new program.  you get ten cents off your total for each of your own bags you bring in.  which brings your total to [total].

i turn my attention to the pay pad, swiping my card, entering my pin, etc.  

and it didn't really register in my mind until just as it was happening: the cashier was reaching for my bag to put my groceries in.  

now, my toys were clean.  they didn't smell, they didn't have any cum or anything on them, but put yourself in the position of this poor woman: you're just trying to get through your day (given the time it was, she had either just started or was just about to leave), and you have a seemingly 'normal' customer with a bag of bdsm toys.

>cashier: oh.  um.  do you want me to bag your groceries for you?

>me: *ohgodohgodohgodohgod* um...no...i've got it...*frantic rush to pay, take my receipt, and get the hell out*

i take my stuff, sit down to check my email to make sure my sub was still meeting me, and who comes by but the manager of the store.

>manager: um, sir?  can you maybe close your bag so it's not open for the entire public to see?

in my rush to sit down in the cafe, i didn't realize that my bag was in the middle of the isle, open for any passerby who happened to look down to see.  i sheepishly reach down, tie the bag shut (it was one of those reusable bags; it didn't have any sort of clasp), and get back to my email.

not only is my sub not meeting me, i'm now known as 'the creep that carries sex toys everywhere' at my favorite grocery store.  i just wanted a sandwich, god damn it.

 

**edit**: oh god now they're disinfecting the whole area where i was sitting...that's just unnecessary",i just wanted a sandwich...
968,"so i was cleaning up my boyfriend's art supplies that were just sitting in the corner of the living room next to the couch. i decided to pack them all up in one of those giant plastic storage containers so that everything wasn't just lying around anymore. i got a text from my boyfriend this afternoon (in somewhat of a panic) asking where all his stuff was. i told him what i had done and where i had put everything and i thought that was that. when i got home from work tonight, i asked why he needed his art supplies so badly and he explained that he has a special towel buried in the box for when he jerks off and apparently he was frantic when he couldn't find it. he told me it ended up being okay, but not to touch the cloth napkin that's now in the kitchen. **(",- i decided to clean up a bit and unknowingly handled my boyfriend's cum rag.)**
969,"just got back from the optometrist in peterborough! 

the eyedrops made my pupils dilate to the point where there was like a 2mm ring around my pupil, nothing more. couldn't see shit.

the optometrist said that what happened was most likely inflammation caused by dryness in the eye.

the cause of this? my hypothyroidism. 

i was given some eyedrops to take if it happens again.

i have two more appointments for this on the 19th of april and on the 1st of may. 

 

actual tl;dr: had optic neuritis, but it was not linked to ms.

970,"so my family (the people i live with) consist of my grandparents, my mother, my father, my little sister, and some pets. today, i was told that i would be home alone and i should take care of the house. knowing that i would be free of the familial prying eye for a good four hours, i decided the most relaxing thing i could possibly do was use the nicest shower in the house (the one by my parent's bedroom) and do my nails in the bed. it was going to be the greatest, most relaxing day of the whole school year. 

i decided after about 10 minutes of deciding between the food network channel and that home and gardening channel (that i hate watching but manage to find time to see a show or two from there once a week), that i would read a book. while most of the books were downstairs, i decided to find a good read somewhere upstairs as i found the lower half of the house (my grandparent's part of the house) to be a wee bit far for someone who's in a state of total relaxation and laziness. i chose a book and started reading.

ten minutes in i hear moaning or yelling or something. i began to freak the fuck out, seeing as my mom told me i'd be home alone. i checked outside to see my grandpa's car parked in the driveway, meaning they were home. i went back to my parents room to read, and after about ten minutes of really loud moaning and them calling out each other's names i came to the realization that my parents' room was directly under my grandparents' bedroom. 

i then came to terms with the fact that i was listening to my grandparents getting it on.","thought i was home alone, had a totally awesome spa day and chilled in my parents bedroom, heard moaning, discovered my grandparents were home, went back to read, heard more intense moaning and realized i spent over ten minutes listening to my grandparents having sex."
971,"so. it's 4:30am and i have to pee...i walk downstairs and notice the kitchen light on...odd it's 4:30am usually no one is awake...boy was i wrong! i get into the kitchen and see my husband standing there...then suddenly i see a light blue wadded piece of fabric and notice the tag. it's a pair of light blue victoria's secrets panties...i don't own light blue victoria's secret panties. at this point my head is flipped, i realize these are my friends panties, a girl we opened our home up to while she was visiting from california. who actually hasn't been here for awhile as she is visiting her dad...instantly he tells me it isn't what it looks like...i ask for an explanation...at this point he hasn't really told me what he does but all i know is he's ""had a thing for women's panties for a year and a half now""...so i start assuming he's jerking off in them....nope...apparently he likes to wear them...i'm not fucking sure how i am suppose to feel right now other than now i know why none of my panties fit, they are all stretched (which pisses me off even more because i spend a lot on nice panties...don't judge)...because my husband has been wearing them...who the fuck does this???

972,"so my dear mother has been in the hospital for a month now and my dad, sister and i take turns staying over with her. tonight was my turn and since there are no beds available for guests at the moment, i fashioned one out of a bunch of chairs and a sleeping bag. at around 4 am i wake up with awful back pains from the damn chairs and decide to rearrange. well, i took one of the many pillows that was piled on a chair, repositioned myself and rubbed my face into the deliciously comfortable hospital pillow. it was then that i got a huge whiff of urine and mom pubes and i realized it was one of the pillows that the nurses placed between her legs so her knees don't rub up against each other. 

:(",i cuddled with a a pillow with traces of my sick mother's urine.
973,"so i was just heading home from the local pie shop (pies are awesome) and noticed the playground nearby. so, naturally, i decided to go over there and look around to see if there was anything that could be even slightly enjoyable. i saw some bucket thing that spins around on an angle, so it goes up and because of the angle it speeds up when going back down. little did i know that the heavier you are (this thing is designed for 7-8 year olds), the faster it spins. had a go on it and when i finally figured out how to stop it i got off dizier that a heavily intoxicated person. started walking in extremely tight circles unable to stop myself and tripped over a log and heavily bruised my leg. 5 hours later it still hurts like crazy. what's worse, 2 girls started laughing at me.","had a go on some ride at a kids playground and became so dizzy that i tripped over a log and bruised my leg, and a few girls started laughing at me."
974,"i'm in the navy working out of an aircraft hangar and today we had the mas (military police) come through our command with a drug dog. standard stuff. well the dog comes up to my desk and he's starting to sniff pretty good, he starts smelling my pocket when all hell breaks loose in this dog's world. he's barking, freaking out, practically shits himself. the ma freaks out also and grabs me and tells me to empty my pockets. so i pull out the 3 bucks i had.

he calls superiors and cuffs me. all this in front of coworkers and my chief. so i'm waiting around for about 2 hours to finally have his first class show up and explain that most money has traces of cocaine and that it isn't an offense at all and to let me go.

to clarify, i don't do coke, but i was freaking out the whole time regardless. all that was going through my head was that i'm fucked because this is technically ""evidence."" i had no idea that dogs could even detect that the dollar could have been used for coke who knows how long ago.",til money can retain old drugs. feel like i dodged a bullet for a crime i didn't commit.
975,"labor day. the last day i worked as a lifeguard at my local pool we decided it would be fun to ride my little bmx bike into the pool, basically just for shits and gigs. 

anyway, after we're done, i'm soaking wet, and we have the bike out of the pool, it's almost closing time and as i'm walking the bike out of the pool area i set it down to fix my bathing suit. 

as i pick it up, it falls off balance and becomes a teeter-totter of nastiness and the tire tears my already soft toenail straight up. it's not so much the pain or the blood, but one of my biggest pet peeves to have a nail come... oh god...",bike tire nearly pulled my toenail off when my bike flipped up
976,"this happened back in high school, but i still fucked up.

we took a field trip to some play. got to the theater, i sit with this girl i've been talking to for a while. i'm cracking jokes, shits going great. she decides to say something funny. it probably wasn't really that funny but i was in love so i busted out laughing. 

the thing was, i had a cold that day and i had been keeping a giant fucking lugie in my mouth because i had nowhere to get rid of it. it was too warm and gross to swallow and i couldn't just spit it on the floor. 

so anyway, she makes me laugh and this wad of my spit and mucous comes flying out of my mouth at mach 10 and lands on her shoulder. 

i'm all o_o

she's fucking repulsed. ""ewwww why did you do that?!""

i needed to fix the situation fast because she was making a scene. quickly, without thinking, i frantically grabbed for my nasal mouth juice. i'm grabbing and snatching, trying to get it off this girl's shirt. 

*rrrrriiiipppp*

her fucking shirt ripped right off. i don't really know how. it was this silky kind of shirt that was all artsy and shit and it just came right off. we were both speechless now but she gave me this look... i'll never forget that look. she broke up with me with that look. 

she took her shirt back and ran to the bathroom and i just sat there with my spit still in my hand.",- i spit mucous on a girl and then ripped her shirt off on a field trip.
977,"well reddit, background story- i don't remember the post or what subreddit it was in, but i recall that a male posted an interesting way to masturbate. by clenching your butt muscles like you are pushing out a bar of fudge during orgasm you will prevent ejaculation momentarily and induce a firehouse of cum (preferably into the back of your so's throat (boyfriend, girlfriend, we all tolerant here)). 

so now that that is all cleared up...my gf recently moved about 250 miles away to complete grad school at a prestigious university for her program. this weekend was her birthday and she was suffering from a bad cold and sore throat so i decided to visit her to cheer her up. i drove all 500 miles total there and back with pretty scenery looking at lots of horses/cows, and we spent some wonderful times bonding with me taking care of her like a knight in shining armor i am. a five hour drive, last minute planned, all for her? she was ecstatic at my get well gifts and bday surprises. commence to sexy times

uh oh, red tides are flowing. and throat is too sore to give olympic gold medal winning blowjobs (athens, 2004). so this great handy would do. after some awesome dry humping and hot kissing and her orgasm... whoops. its fucking superbad up in the joint and i got a period blood stain on my underoos. oh well, i brought extra and this is a long term thing, we're cool with that. she proceeds to touch and caress and woman-handle my cock like its [that pottery sex scene in ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw8j818w-qe).

i'm getting ready to blow, and i alert her to the imminent eruption. i remember that technique i read and as soon as i felt that familiar build up i squeezed those butt muscles and... farted in my gf's face. what's worse was i let go of the muscles and started laughing uncontrollably and cumming all over myself while my girlfriend blank-stared at my immaturity level and pulled on my dick with the enthusiasm of a worker on an 8-hr factory shift ... but also was confused at something. like a dude with toes for thumbs or some shit. 

anyways,",i ruined a really good handy by farting and immaturely laughing my way through my orgasm. oh and i came on her pillow too. whoops
978,"so this actually happened two years ago, but whatevs. i still fucked up.

i was at the gas station late one night, about to buy $20 in gas and a snickers. i got talking to the guy at the register, because work was slow that night, and he was cuuuuuuute.

he failed to get the register open and went in the back to ask his manager. i saw this as a great opportunity to let a fart i'd been holding back. i went to the other side of the station, looked around, and saw that the coast was clear.

(◕‿◕✿)< toooooot~

""fuck!!""

i jumped out of my skin!! i turned around, and this time, i looked down. i saw a.... i guess the pc term is ""little person."" he was hood as hell, too. gold chains, tatts, everything.

""that was wrong. that was not. even. right.""

i was just... in shock. this guy came out of nowhere, and here i was, looking like i deliberately ripped ass in his face. he went on a rant about how i was racist, and how hard it is to be short in the hood. i tried to apologize, but he was hearing none of it. he don't need no cracker-ass ho lettin' poots up in his grill.

there weren't many people in the store, but they were staring right the fuck at me. look at this evil bitch, farting on black midgets. the cute cashier came back. oh god no, i can't let him know that i fart.

""excuuuse me!"" the lowercase g yelled to the cashier. ""this girl-""

before he could finish, i took off running. i bolted to my car and drove to the gas station down the road, where i was careful not to poot on anyone.",tried to pick up a cute guy but farted in a dwarf's face.
979,"i'll admit, this wasn't today, but actually yesterday because i was very sick and i couldn't drag myself to the computer or phone to write this.

so yesterday my family went out to a fairly fancy restaurant. they have surprisingly large portions along with very rich food (you can tell where this is going). earlier that day i had gone to in-n-out and gotten a lemonade, animal-style fries, double double burger, and a milkshake for an early lunch. throughout the day i had been drinking delicious lemonade made with lemon's fresh from our neighbors yard.

my stomach seemed to be complying the entire time we were at the restaurant and on our way (it was an hour drive). when we got there, i ordered some smoothie thing with various fruits and a tea. for dinner, i had some really rich fish and rice. for dessert, i had a huge chocolate cake. at this point i was still feeling good. my stomach hurt a little, but it was the pain that you get after you ate way too much food (which i did). i fell asleep on the way home, so i couldn't tell if my stomach hurt.

i woke up to a slight discomfort (different than the full feeling i had earlier) but thought nothing of it. ten minutes later it was starting to hurt a little more, but i figured i would be in the clear for the night. another ten minutes later and was hurting even more. then, all the sudden, out of nowhere, i ran to the bathroom with explosive diarrhea. i managed to get the toilet seat up and get my pants down before i exploded into the toilet, but it made a huge mess. it was all over the seat and stuck to the side of the bowl. i sat hunched over the bowl for a good ten minutes hoping the pain would subside, but it didn't do that. i then flushed the toilet and decided to lay on the bathroom floor because i thought i was going to throw up.

so i'm laying on the floor, pants off (i had enough foresight to realize i would need to take them off) with a shitty butt in the fetal position holding my stomach. maybe twenty minutes before my stomach decides to make those horrid gurgly noises. i knew what was coming (eventually). i'm waiting for the inevitable to hit me, when all the sudden the door to the bathroom opens. i was too weak to scream at whoever it was, but i jerked up and saw my sister's eyes darting back between my shitty ass (. right at that moment, (i don't know if it was because i jerked up or if my stomach just decided to betray me), my stomach decides it's time to expel all the contents from my body.

i jerk up, turn to kneel over the toilet, and let loose a geyser. i throw up literally everything i had eaten that day, which was a lot. it hurt so bad coming up, but i fought through the pain. halfway through, i realize two things. one, i have to shit again. two, i am not going to be able to stop vomiting for long enough to position my butt over the toilet. shit starts to pour from my ass as i am letting out toxic, smelly vomit from my mouth. the shit went everywhere: the wall, my legs, the floor, and the towels. eventually all the contents were gone from my stomach and bowels, but not before making a huge mess which i got to clean up.

to make matters, worse my sister decided to watch my entire display. i honestly don't know why she didn't just turn around and walk away. we haven't even been able to look at each other since this event.","i got really sick from rich food and my sister walked in on me naked with a shitty ass. then, she got to watch me simultaneously vomit in the toilet and shit on the floor."
980,"this woman must have been at least 95 years old. she was old as fuck. she had a walker with her and had many shopping bags with her. when i knocked her down, i also dropped several of my own bags. 

i got really nervous and embarrassed after knocking her down, so i quickly scrambled the fuck out of there. turns out that i accidentally took one of her shopping bags with a few garments in it (receipt says the total cost was around ~$108).","knocked over granny, stole her clothes."
981,"this actually happened a month or two ago but i was just informed today about the colossal goat fuck i caused this poor dude.  

i live across the street from a bar where i have become quite the regular along with some old timers from the subsidized housing building next door. often referred to as the delaney crew (name of the building they live in)  these elderly gentlemen provide quite the comic relief and provide a pretty steady stream of perils of wisdom.  every once in a while they will even attempt to wing-man for you, it never works but i suspect it's just a genius excuse to put their arm around an unsuspecting bar fly and rub their junk on them.  often, they get shitfaced and end up needing a helping hand across the street, a task that i have somehow inherited, though i don't mind it. 

one day in particular, the delaney boys are taking quite a bit of booze to the face as is customary when social security checks arrive. most of the crew disperses aside from one new face, who was having a hard time forming words, thoughts and equilibrium.  i was amongst other friends when i noticed this guy fall straight backwards, off his bar stool and thumped his dome pretty hard on the hardwood floor.  as the unofficial keeper of the codgers, i sprung from my chair and went to assist.  he seemed disoriented but overall okay.  i helped him to his feet and told my crew i would walk him across the street and would soon return.  the old man, who i will call gordy, was appreciative but not much help in explaining to me what his apartment number was.  typically i would just pour them into a lobby chair but gordy was pretty tanked so i decided to take him all the way to his apartment.  i was able to discern that his unit number was 609 and found the door to be unlocked, helped him into his lazy boy, handed him a glass of water and showed myself out.  back at the bar i got a free beer and life went on...  

fast forward to today..  i see gordy for the first time and walk up to say hi and see if he recalled me helping him.  boy did her ever.  gordy, confused at first, quickly turned angry and all pointy fingery in my chest.  turns out gordy does indeed live in unit 609, of another building two blocks away.  fuck me right?!  gordy angrily explains that some elderly lady awoke to him pissing in her kitchen.  she proceeded to assault him with a umbrella until law enforcement arrived and hauled him off to jail for a variety of charges.  fuuuuck.. i think gordy understands it was a well intentioned gesture gone bad but he remained pretty pissed.","took a drunk grandpa to the wrong apartment, left him there to be assaulted and jailed"
982,"so i live in quebec, where french is the language of 80% of the population, and i was raised in another country with english as my first language. so i tend to get grouped in with the english-speaking canadians - and the running joke in the province is either that they don't speak french, or when they do, they do it hilariously badly.

so, determined to prove them wrong, and having studied french to university level, i have embarked on a campaign to try and get into as many french conversations as possible, if only just to improve my level and get used to the accent. so i'm at a staff party (i am the only english-first-language member of staff) this evening, it's quite a formal event, people have suits on and all that. dinner's served, and my boss gets up and makes a speech. everyone claps. then, as the ""new import"" (as he refers to me), he asks if i'd like to get up and talk about my first few months in quebec.

so i walk up to the front and clear my throat, ready to unleash my best french on a room of my peers. for the first minute or so, everything goes perfectly. i pronounce stuff correctly, i don't hesitate and people are listening.

then, i decide i'll up things a little bit by using an idiom - i wanted to say that their welcome had took my breath away, and i really liked/appreciated it. now, in french, to say that, you say [something] ""m'a coupé le souffle"" [pronounced ma coo-pay luh soo-fluh]. so i think ""this'll impress them"" and i come out with something along the lines of ""l'acceuil que j'ai réçu dès mon arrivée m'a sifflé le cul, ce qui j'apprécie"" [lakkuy kuh zhey reysu dess mon arr-ee-vay ma see-flay luh cool, suh kuh jap-ray-sea]. someone sniggers as i realised i mispronounced the last part, mixing up the ends of the words. i think nothing of it, just thinking people are laughing at my funny foreign accent. i finish and wait for a stuttered round of applause.

people struggle to keep a straight face as i walk down, shake hands with my boss and he says ""thanks for that [lgf92], it was really...interesting.""

when i get back to the table, someone asks if i didn't mean ""coupé le souffle"". i said ""yeah, didn't i say that?"" he says ""no, you said 'sifflé le cul'...[in english] which means, er, whistled in my ass."" laughter all round. i drink another couple of glasses of wine.",told a room full of french speakers that i really liked it that their welcome had whistled my asshole.
983,"walking home from an exam, pretty tired and drained.

see someone walking towards us, as they get close i just yell:

""hey, fuck you!!""

i then proceeded to make the poor bastard high-five me. i wondered why he seemed so... *hesitant*, but didn't dwell on it.

cut to me later on teamspeak with some people. let's call the person i *thought* it was... ""j"".

me: ""guess who i met today? j!""  
j: ""you... haven't seen me today. that didn't happen.""  
me: ""uhh... what? you sure? ^^^we ^^^high ^^^fived ^^^and ^^^everything! ^^^^^^and ^^^^^^i ^^^^^^said ^^^^^^fuck ^^^^^^you ^^^^^^o_o

984,"on this dreary and lonely night, i decided to look up 'porn' on 'youtube'


(yeah, porn on youtube... good job)


i eventually found something graphic, and decided to watch it, but i pressed tvqueue and it played on my dads 52 inch plasma with  surround sound.


he is still giving me the look to this minute...",gave my dad youtube porn on his tv
985,"little background here: long story short, my mom kicked my dad out this summer (i'm 17) for reasons that don't pertain to the story. he's physically disabled (broke both ankles) and very depressed. my dad was working at his buddy's auto shop doing computer work like ordering parts and keeping things on file. 

well, the economy's in the shitter (or he has a shitty friend) so he got laid off yesterday because they didn't need him. i had a lot of anxiety over this, because my dad has almost nothing of worth in his life besides me and my sister (whom he only sees when my mom works) and i felt a lot of pity and frustration for his situation. distraught, i tried to text my good lady friend about it. 

the text went, ""damn my dad just lost his job.."" i expected a sympathetic response, but was thoroughly confused when i got a text back saying ""thx for the recap"".

i texted my dad.","venting to my friend about my dad getting laid off, accidentally sent text to dad."
986,"after a great night of entertainment and conversation, we go back to her place, we have a few drinks (mostly consumed by her), i put her to bed and start to go into the living room to sleep off my alcohol, then she grabs me and starts grinding me on her bed. after very feeble attempts to get her to stop, i just go along with it for a while, because i'm stupid, somewhat drunk, and extremely horny. one thing leads to another, and she's completely naked and i'm fingering her. she asks me for sex, i refuse because i have to condoms. she asks again after a few more minutes, again, i refuse. she almost begs me the third time and i seriously considered it, then reminded myself that i'm a shitty fucking person for even letting it get this far along, and refuse a final time. i help her get dressed again, she asks me to leave a little bit later, i do. 


fast forward to a few hours later, she sends me a message asking for a rundown of what happened because her memory is foggy. i answer truthfully, saying we engaged in some foreplay and she asked me to have sex with her several times, but that i couldn't go through with it and she asked me to leave shortly afterward. now she's very upset because i didn't stop her, and rightfully so because the right thing to do would have been just that. now i feel like a monster and want to kick myself repeatedly in the testicles.","finger banged my friend while she was drunk, almost had sex with her, now she hates me and i feel like a piece of shit."
987,"last night actually, but i was driving back from a friends house after drinking a few beers and shooting the shit. stopped off for a late night gyro and began the hour long trek back to my house.

round about halfway through the drive i had to pee really bad, like really bad, so i had the bright idea to use all my powers of multitasking and pee in an empty snapple bottle while still driving (dumb, i know). get myself set up and do the deed, fill up the bottle with about a millimeter to spare, cap it off and keep driving.

now i'm moving along, feeling proud of my urination/driving prowess when i look down at the bottle sitting in my passenger seat and notice that the shitty seal on the cap is letting piss dribble out and soak into the chair..... god damn it!

acting quickly i press the passenger window button down, move over in the right lane and chuck the bottle out into the wilderness (again, a shitty thing to do i know). the second the bottle leaves my hand though,  **crash!** and the whole interior of my car is instantly covered in broken glass...

it takes me a good 10 seconds to assess the situation and realize what the shit has happened, but in my haste to rid myself of the drippy pee bottle i'd actually opened the *back* passenger window instead of the front one, and had in fact just thrown it at a closed window.",i shattered a window in my car with a bottle full of my own urine.
988,"i dun fucked up guys. 

i've only tried weed once before, and i didn't feel it at all, so i haven't had it since. but the other night i drove someone home from work and he asked if i wanted to smoke with him, and i had some cash to spare so i said sure, just for the hell of it.

well, i didn't feel it immediately like he did, it took me about 20 minutes to start feeling it (btw, wasn't all it's cracked up to be, i just felt really stupid and lightheaded). so about halfway through my drive home, i decide to call my girlfriend and talk to her. well the conversation quickly dissolved into an argument over her hanging out with her ex alone, and then it turned to if she cared about my emotions at all, and then if she even loved me.

now in my defense, i was pretty high at this point, and i know i was because i could not construct an argument to save my life, and i remember having like, a couple minute intervals where i was just trying to think of things to say and trying to remember what we just said.

anyway, it got to a point where i broke up with her over text, but i did make it obvious that i would welcome her back if the issue with caring and affection was fixed.

so, as soon as i came off of my high, i realized what a fucking retard i was. we've almost been together for a year, we were finally about to fix the issues between her and my parents, we both just turned 18 and had an entire summer ahead of us, and i was planning a surprise trip for us to go to busch gardens for a few days. and i really, really love her, of course. i'm an idiot for letting her go.

and it's basically made me pretty depressed the last few days. i haven't really been eating (yesterday for dinner i ate for the first time in 28 hours), i don't have any enthusiasm for friends or games or anything, i just want to sit around all day in my bed and do nothing. oh, i can't really get an erection either.

i wouldn't feel so bad, but she seems to be adamant (judging by what she's said to others) that she's not going to come back, which is completely heartbreaking. 

so, yeah, that's it i guess. i don't need to be told that there's going to be someone else, or that there's more fish in the sea, or whatever. to be quite honest, i was *extremely* lucky to land someone like her. nobody else i've ever met has compared, even from the very first night that we met i knew that there was something special about her.

anyway, fucking never smoking weed again, fuck that shit. at least when i get drunk i don't do stupid stuff, i just get really giggly and incoherent. will update if by some miracle she does decide to come back.","got actually high off weed for the first time, acted like an idiot, dumped my girlfriend, she said to others that she is never coming back, can't get a boner, i'm crying myself to sleep every night and not eating anymore**"
989,"because i've been so caught up this week in trying to clean my mess, i didn't even get a chance to get my folks a proper anniversary gift. not to mention, it's mother's day today and i still didn't get a chance to get my mom anything because i've been locked in my room trying to get myself together. girl whom i've had a relationship with for 4 years (on and off) had to be told that i messed with her closest friend a couple years back when we were having severe issues. my parents know this girl's parents and probably have to put their heads down in shame every time they see them now. they supposed to be somewhere today where they're going to bump into them.

990,"lunch started out normal, sitting with my friends eating the excuse for food they serve at schools. i'm having a chicken patty sandwich and fries so i have loads of ketchup on my tray. i start telling a story and get super into it making wild hand gestures and such. one of the gestures ends in my hand accidentally making forceful contact with my milk carton. ""oh shit!"" my milk empties most of its contents into my ketchup and my tray with some milk landing on the table. i go back up to the front to get napkins to clean up my terrible mess. i wipe the table dry and realize i need more ketchup because the stuff i currently have is saturated with chocolate milk. i return to the front yet again to get more ketchup this time. i put the ketchup in a different section of the tray because i hadn't cleaned the brown and red mess out of my tray; that's a job for the lunch ladies. as i'm returning to my table apparently i tilted the tray as a result of holding it with one hand. so i sit back down and one of my friends tells me i have a little milk in my new ketchup. ""dammit!"" i use the napkins to get as much milk out of my new ketchup as possible. one of my friends sitting across the table from me informs me that he can smell my mixture of milk and ketchup and sadness. so like anyone would i lean forward to sniff it and see what it smells like. that was a terrible mistake. it smelled like someone decided to deep fry week old shit and let it bask in the sun for a month before reheating it in a microwave. now not only do i feel like puking, i also have milk and ketchup on the white shirt i was wearing. today i done fucked up.","spilled milk in ketchup, got more ketchup and did it again. smelled the rancid mixture and accidentally got some on my white shirt."
991,"first post, so here goes...

let me start by saying how much i hate when my sister has friends over. she's in those pre-teen years where she has to look invincible in front of her friends. slightly unrelated, but today she had a friend over, and god did they (mainly she) piss me off...

first up, i'm sitting in my room, watching random youtube videos on my laptop. i get up to go to the bathroom, and leave my laptop open on my bed, next to my cat (my cat loves me/my bed. not sure which.) so as i finish up in the bathroom, i enter my room just in time to see my sister sit down next to my cat. on top of my laptop.

now she's not fat by any means, but a half-inch thick ultrabook is not supposed to take 50-odd kilos of weight, especially not on the edge of the open screen. needless to say, even my sister, with her extremely limited knowledge of computers, could tell that it was way beyond repair. screen shattered and completely separated from the keyboard, she bolts out of the room, leaving a very stunned friend with a furious me.

second time, about half an hour later while i'm discussing the laptop situation with my parents, i'm looking with a certain degree of loathing out the window to where my sister and her friend are mucking about in the garden. sitting on the trampoline is a parrot. now, i don't really take special notice of birds in our backyard since my sister started hand-feeding the kookaburras, but i probably should have done something about this one (not that i knew what was about to happen.)

anyway, my sister decides she would show off some trampoline tricks. as i've said, she hand-feeds most birds coming through our backyard, so they're all pretty comfortable around us. anyway, she gets up on the trampoline, facing her friend. and jumps.

apart from the whole dead parrot problem (which has traumatised her pretty badly), i now have a $1700 pile of wiring and other parts which are completely useless. she owns pretty much nothing, and is too young to work, so there's the issue of a replacement to sort out (pretty sure sitting on it voided the warranty). it's like sueing a homeless person; you'll win, but you won't win much.","sister broke my $1700 laptop, killed parrot."
992,"some background - a friend (we'll call him paul) and i were staying out of town for a search and rescue conference for a few days showing off our uav aircraft.

i was taking a shower before we hit the road when i heard the clunk of the front door of our hotel room, ''ok paul is loading up the car'' i thought to myself. about 5 minutes later i heard my phone ringing. odd i thought as i checked and it was paul: ''let me in dude!''. now keep in mind that you have to go through 2 doors to the hotel room, both of which require a key card. i guess paul must have forgotten his key card so i shut the shower off, tied a towel around my waist and walked out the front door to let my pal in like any true friend. i open the front door of the hotel and paul is nowhere to be found. whatever, he'll find his way in. walking back up to my hotel room, it hits me. shit, i didn't grab the key card either. well fuck, now what? wet and wearing only a towel around my waist i walk to the front desk on the other side of the hotel and explain my scenario to the clerk, and while i was getting another card paul comes walking in the door, and as soon as he realizes he's looking at me the laughing sets in. the 3 of us all laugh it off, i get a new card, all is well. it gets better though, as paul and i were walking back to the room i hear him say ''cheese! smile for the camera bigpinecone!'' and when i turn around he's holding his phone up ''click click click''

993,"so my roommates are away for the weekend. we have this system where we take turns with chores, and since i'm absolutely useless at cooking, one of the other girls generally does that. since they weren't here, i decided to stock up on frozen indian food from trader joe's. i followed the instructions to a t (this is one thing i can actually do) and i felt pretty confident about my frozen-food making abilities. i even decided to go big and follow the oven instructions rather than the microwave ones.

naturally, the meal sets the smoke alarm off when i take it out of the oven.

this probably wouldn't have been a big deal except i live in a duplex. i'm on the phone with my roommate asking her how to turn off the oven when the next door neighbor guy, an awkward it guy about 10 years older than me, comes over. i see him out the window, literally running toward my front door. of course at this point i'm wearing absolutely no pants. hey, i'm home alone and i had a hard week. i run back to my room, giving him a what i realized later was a full back view from the front window, of course, and throw on some shorts. after opening the door, we open all the windows to get the smoke out.

(yeah, it has an attic.) i woke up around 6, having no idea what was going on and yet still drunk enough to not be offput by that. i felt kinda damp, but i figured it was just sweat, since i was fully clothed still. i went back downstairs to the party, which by then only had the hostess and one other guy left. when i got down there, i either realized or was told by them that it wasn't sweat...it was urine. i felt kinda embarrassed but basically stripped down and put on something else. a couple minutes later i realized i should take everything out of the pockets...keys, a tube of blistex i tossed immediately, wallet (gross, but i needed to get rid of it anyway, and the cash was fine), and then...my phone. disgusting, and completely fucked. it took me ages to figure out why - it didn't seem wet or pissy at the time - and it wasn't until i went back to bed and woke up again i realized why it wouldn't turn on.",the good: gave my friend a lapdance. bad: phone assassinated by my bladder while i slept. the ugly: gave my friend a lapdance.

997,"i have to start off by saying that this didn’t happen today. not yesterday, not last week even, but on this day precisely one year ago. however, i can still feel (or rather *not* feel) the consequences of it today, so i feel this post is somewhat justified.


to provide a little background: i had been on an internship in paris for the past three months and everything was going absolutely swell. i made some great friends, professionally things couldn’t be better and overall i had a blast spending time abroad alone for the first time in my life. being in paris just added to that experience. to quote my man ernest: 
“if you are lucky enough to have lived in paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for paris is a moveable feast.” anyway, i digress. 


the residence i stayed at had its own little gym so i had been working out religiously during my time there. i was really getting into shape and becoming stronger. of course, with added power comes added cockiness so when a friend challenged me to a game of arm-wrestling one lovely saturday night i immediately accepted, gloating about his incumbent demise.


*i got this.*


turns out, i didn’t. we had been going at it for a good 30 seconds and i was at a small advantage but this dude was still not giving in. apparently, slightly inebriated germans are rather strong. me being extremely sober thought that i could maybe wear him out enough so that he would just give up. this didn’t seem to work and i tried to give it one last push with all my measly strength.


then it happened. crack. thud. argh.  my arm loudly banged against the table, in the opposite direction mind you. i didn’t realize what just had happened but my body sure as hell did. i couldn’t control myself and started yelling incoherent sounds, all the while breathing very loudly. the pain was very intense but started numbing down quickly when i sat down again. whenever i tried moving my arm, it started twitching. honestly i just thought i had torn a muscle or something.


an ambulance was called in and i was soon rushed to hospital. i was checked in and told to wait. overall i had to wait for 4 hours in the er which wasn’t the most pleasant of experiences. (during that time i saw a guy with a beret strapped to a stretcher trying to fight two nurses because they called him monsieur while he’d rather be called madame. aah, paris, comme je vous adore)


anyway, when someone finally came to see what kind of dire straits i had gotten myself into, they just started berating me. i was a blithering idiot for arm-wrestling, i had been the third guy that month with the same injuries (didn’t even know you could break your arm while arm-wrestling, let alone that this wasn’t a very rare freak accident). in the meantime, my arm had swollen to schwarzenegger proportions and the guy examining me asked if i was on steroids. no thanks, i wasn’t. he told me i had broken my humerus and that i needed surgery asap. great.


the next morning i had surgery and the surgeon came to me afterwards and said everything had gone over smoothly and that i should be as good as new in a few weeks. however, i still couldn’t move my arm after two weeks and the doctors concluded that they probably had severed a nerve. (maybe the surgeon can post a tifu from his perspective)


long story short, my wrist and fingers were paralyzed for 7 months and only in the last few months have i been making progress. i still have a pretty bad-ass scar and a few insensitive spots on my arm to make me remember my fuck up.

998,"sadly today i return to you, tifu, with another masturbatory cautionary tale. some may remember me as [the buckyballs guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/13uidx/tifu_by_combining_magnets_with_my_urethra_nsfw/). after that incident, i hoped (and, indeed, swore) that i would never darken the door of tifu again.

alas.

once again, i had some time to myself. having fully explored the magic of sounding, today i was returning to an old standby of mine; self-bondage. could i put myself in an insecapable situation for a predetermined length of time? child's play! how dull. what could i do to make things more... interesting? 

i was cautious, tifu. i was. i am learning wisdom in my old age.  you see, i tested the tabasco beforehand. i put a smidgen- a smidgen, mark you- on the head of my penis, and left it for a while. a nice warmth spread through the poor wee dear. perfect.

my testing was inadequate.

i strapped myself up, and strapped myself down. i set the clock for 35 minutes; 5 minutes to finish the preparations, then 30 minutes of fun. and here, here is the part where i fucked up. i got a plastic bag, one of those little freezer bags. i shook the tabasco bottle into it a few times. then i gently, lovingly, carefully placed my twig and berries inside the bag and sealed it up with tape. i now had a darling little condom-like structure, except encasing everything vital to a man. 

from here i moved swiftly. no time for second thoughts. i clicked my hands into place behind my back, and was stuck.

why, you ask, was my testing inadequate? what had i neglected? the title of the post, o observant reader, may give you some clue. the testicles are deeply, horrifically sensitive to the effects of tabasco. my little soldier was quite happy; he was basking in the rewarding glow of work well done. his cannonballs, however, were not. 

over the space of thirty seconds, what had been a mild annoyance escalated to the most painful thing i have ever felt. this is not hyperbole. i have broken arms, cut penises, lost love. this was worse. my gonads had been dipped in a sea of molten glass.

fortunately, i had just enough reach to pull the bag off my poor suffering self. this made absolutely no difference. this was an emergency. i was genuinely worried i had some sort of chemical burn. visions of hospitals and eunuchs swam through my fading mind. 

long story short, i used my back up safety scissors to cut through some rather expensive bondage equipment and spent an hour dangling my red and angry self in a sink of cold water. anything approaching normal body temperature brought the pain back, fresh and new, like a bounding young puppy eager to play. 

stick to the oral tabasco route, kiddies.

999,"eat salad for lunch. sometimes the sharp corners of a post-it, or envelope, can push out stuff between your teeth, ya know? well today i got one good and stuck right between my front teeth. in my attempt to pull it out the (hot pink) post-it ripped, wedging its remains further into my gums. i used a plastic tea bag corner to finally push it down and out. felt some considerable tooth movement in the process. now my front teeth don't touch.",i properly undid 3+ years of night time retainer wearing.
